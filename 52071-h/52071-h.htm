<p>In these days otter-hunting is a popular sport, and
in consequence there are now many more packs of
otterhounds than was formerly the case. Of all
beasts of chase in this country, the otter is the one
about which we know least, for he is a great
wanderer, a creature of the night, and therefore
difficult to study systematically.</p>

<p>Of the many people who follow hounds, comparatively
few understand the science of hunting, or
the habits of the creature which forms their quarry.
This is probably to some extent due to the fact
that there are very few books dealing exclusively
with the otter and his hunting. A knowledge of
the science of hunting and the habits of the quarry
can be picked up by those who have leisure to
study the subject afield, but there are others whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">« 8 »</a></span>
opportunities of doing so are limited. It is,
therefore, in the hope of interesting and perhaps
instructing the latter, that we have written the
following chapters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Clapham</span>,&mdash;I am much flattered at
your invitation to write an introduction to your
"Book of the Otter," and only wish I were a good
enough hand with the pen to do your most
interesting book the justice it deserves.</p>

<p>If I were asked to find fault with your work I
should say its only failing was its brevity. And
I would ask for a few more hunts and to have
them rather more elaborated. And if you could
not only expound to whips, either amateur or
professional, how you do your own work as such
<i>but make them into whips as good as yourself
thereby</i> you would take an enormous amount of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">« 14 »</a></span>
worry and responsibility off many a huntsman's
shoulders.</p>

<p>As you say in your letter to me, a book on
such an interesting subject is sure to create a
friendly criticism, more particularly on such
controversial subjects as early meets versus late
ones and pure-bred otterhounds versus draft
foxhounds.</p>

<p>Admittedly you and I have always taken rather
opposite views on these two questions, so despite
the very fair pros and cons you give these
respective arguments in your book, may I put in
a further argument in each case on behalf of
hounds?</p>

<p>Take early meets with a pack hunting three
and four days a week. It is only possible to have
early meets in the hottest part of the year&mdash;say
middle of June to end of August in our North
Country, and a rather longer period with South
and West Country packs. Say hounds meet at
five a.m. on four days in the week. Hounds may
have to take anything from one to two hours to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">« 15 »</a></span>
get from kennels to the meet. The men are in
kennel at least an hour before the hunting pack
turns out, so we know that hounds get no rest
after that hour, which is probably shortly after
two a.m. Hounds would normally be back in
kennel after a day of this sort within an hour or
two of midday. For the rest of that day, apart
from the disturbance&mdash;to hounds&mdash;of ordinary
kennel routine, they are unable to get genuine
rest on a hot summer's afternoon. The result is
that after a fortnight, or even a week of such work&mdash;and
I have many instances in my old hunting
diaries of both&mdash;you get a jaded pack, a tired
staff, and a weary Master. And I have been
unfortunate enough myself to have never seen
even a hunt before eight a.m.</p>

<p>If anyone will guarantee to put hounds on to
the line of a travelling dog otter on a given day I
would be there with hounds every time. But
otherwise, no thank you.</p>

<p>As to otterhounds versus foxhounds, I am
convinced that finance, or rather the lack of it, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">« 16 »</a></span>
the only reason why draft foxhounds are preferred
to otterhounds. Otter-hunting is a poor man's
sport, and few people realise what it costs to run
a pack and country. If you get a Master to take
a country he has very often spent enough out of
his own pocket when he has paid the difference
between the subscription list and the hunting
expenses. And breeding hounds on a big scale
adds enormously to expenses. The result is that
in nine cases out of ten the pack is made up of
draft dog foxhounds, and a very few rough-coated
otterhounds. An attempt may be made to breed
a litter or two a year from the rough otterhound
bitches. Five or six puppies may be got out to
walk, and three or four left in kennel. As many
of these as survive&mdash;possibly two and a half or
three couple&mdash;are brought on the following season,
and unless they are hopeless physical wrecks
they are put into the pack to keep up the theory
that they are a pack of <i>otterhounds</i>. And good
or bad workers they are often kept on for this
same purpose only. Under these circumstances,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">« 17 »</a></span>
and they are far from uncommon, no wonder the
average member of an otter-hunting field prefers
the foxhound. Any M.O.H. can get draft foxhounds,
and frequently get them as a gift&mdash;hounds
that have been the best of fox-hunters and fox-catchers,
but have got too slow or for any of a
dozen other reasons are unable to run up to the
pace of a modern foxhound pack. These draft
hounds know all about hunting, and only want
entering to their new quarry to make most
excellent otter-hunting hounds at a minimum of
expense and trouble.</p>

<p>But if an M.O.H. breeds otterhounds on the
same lines that foxhounds are bred, breeds by
selection, breeds each year enough puppies to get
a big enough young entry the following year&mdash;big
enough not only to be able to put down
immediately any physical crock that may come
in, but big enough to allow for drafting a certain
number&mdash;during and at the end of their first
season you can have, in my humble opinion, a
pack of pure-bred otterhounds, not only not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">« 18 »</a></span>
inferior to, but superior to any pack of draft
foxhounds. I may appear too enthusiastic on this
point&mdash;I am certainly rather disappointed. I
bought my first otterhounds in 1903. I started
breeding in 1905. In July, 1914, having for two
or three years prior to that date put over fifty
puppies out to walk each year, I had just over forty
couple of pure-breed otterhounds in kennel. And
I was hoping to prove that before many more years
passed my confidence in the otterhound was not
misplaced. But in 1919 I was reduced to under
ten couple, and circumstances have since prevented
me continuing my experiment to anything
like the same extent. And I must say that I have
never found the otterhound quarrelsome either in
kennel or out.</p>

<p>I hope you will forgive my keen advocacy on
behalf of the pure-bred otterhound. I am sure
we should both dislike to see him entirely
eliminated from the hunting-field, and only to be
found as a weird and useless animal on the show
bench.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">« 19 »</a></span></p>

<p>May your book have the great success that it
deserves. That it will give great pleasure to all
who know anything about the otter and the
hunting of it, I am sure. That it will be the
means of attracting many new converts I devoutly
hope. And if I may add a wish with a yet more
personal note, may I meet yourself and all my
other good otter-hunting friends at many another
good hunt, whether the meet be late or early, the
hounds otterhounds or foxhounds.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE NATURAL HISTORY OF THE OTTER</span></p>


<p>The common otter of the British Islands, known
in scientific classification as <i>Lutra vulgaris</i>,
belongs to the Mustelidæ, or in other words the
weasel family. Included in the latter are the
martens and their allies, whose chief attributes
are activity, length of body and tail, shortness
of legs, widely separated toes, and small claws.
The otter is the possessor of similar attributes,
with additional developments to fit it for an
aquatic existence. If therefore we describe the
otter as an aquatic marten, living chiefly on a
fish diet, we shall probably not be deviating
very far from the truth. Swimming is an
inherited instinct handed down through the ages,
and though it has been lost by man, it has been
developed and taken advantage of by many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">« 22 »</a></span>
creatures, in order to enable them to lead an
aquatic existence. The reason for this intensive
development of their swimming powers by
certain animals probably lies in the fact that
aquatic life opened a wider and safer field for
them, both in the matter of food supplies and
protection from their natural enemies.</p>

<p>The otter family is widely distributed over
the globe, so before entering upon a detailed
description of our British otter, it may be of interest
to glance at other species inhabiting foreign
countries. The typical otters are marine as well
as aquatic in their habits, many of them visiting the
sea, where they live in the caves and other retreats
along the coast. There is one of the family,
however, i.e., the sea-otter, which is entirely
marine. The skin of this otter has always been
keenly sought for by fur-traders and trappers, and
it is owing to constant harassing by such people
that the sea-otter is now all but extinct. This
otter differs in many ways from its aquatic relations.
It possesses large flipper-like hind feet, a short tail,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">« 23 »</a></span>
and small, delicate forefeet. The hind paws
alone are used for swimming, the delicate and
sensitive forefeet being employed in locating the
otter's food, consisting of mussels, crabs, and other
shell-fish, which it hunts for amongst the rocks at
the bottom of the sea. This otter spends its entire
existence in salt water, and has been found as far
as twenty miles from land.</p>

<p>The female usually has but a single young one,
born, so it is thought, on the large beds of seaweed
commonly known as kelp. Lying on her back in
the sea, the mother sleeps and suckles her baby
in that position.</p>

<p>In Africa there is a species known as the spotted-necked
otter, which has shorter ears, longer toes,
and more hair about its nose than the common
otter. Africa also produces a large otter which
has more or less given up its aquatic habits. The
claws on this otter's forepaws have disappeared,
while those on the hind feet have practically done
so. In India there is a small otter whose claws
resemble those of the foregoing, and in both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">« 24 »</a></span>
animals the sense of touch in the forepaws is
extremely delicate, which no doubt enables the
creatures to locate certain of their prey by feeling
for it. In the large African otter the webs between
the toes are greatly reduced, and the facial bristles
or "whiskers" are much softer than those
possessed by the common otter.</p>

<p>South America can boast of a very large otter,
whose tail is wider and more flattened than is the
case with the otters above mentioned. It will thus
be seen that there are only slight differences
between individuals composing the typical otters.</p>

<span class="smcap">Otter's Rudder.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The common British otter (<i>Lutra vulgaris</i>) is
known by a variety of names in this country. The
Welsh call the animal dwrgi, while in Cornish it
is written durgi. In the Highlands, where Gaelic
is spoken, the name is dòbhran. The physical
formation of the otter is admirably adapted to fit
it for an aquatic existence. In order to offer the
least possible resistance to the water when the
animal is swimming below the surface, the otter's
head and muzzle are flattened, and the ears are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">« 25 »</a></span>
very small. Both ears and nostrils can be closed
to exclude the water. The body
is long, low, and sinuous in
movement, set upon short legs
which are loosely articulated.
The feet are palmate, with five
toes armed with short, non-retractile
claws, and perfect interdigital
webs. The tail is more
than half the length of the head
and body, broad at the base, and
horizontally flattened. Beneath
the root of the tail will be found
a pair of small glands containing
a fetid liquid secretion. Being
an aquatic, sub-Arctic species, the
otter is furnished with a body
covering of two kinds. The thick,
close under-fur, which attains
special luxuriance of growth, is
provided for two purposes, i.e., for keeping
out the wet when the animal is in the water,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">« 26 »</a></span>
and for preventing loss of heat during cold
weather. Overlying this under-coat is a covering
of longer hairs, which are stiffer and more
shiny, greyish in colour at the base, and brown at
the tips. This dark colouring shows in most
pronounced fashion on the upper portions of the
body, and on the outer surfaces of the legs and
shoulders. The inner portions of the legs, belly,
chest, throat, and cheeks are brownish-grey. The
throat often shows a good deal of white or greyish-white
in irregular patches. This, however, varies
considerably in individual specimens, some showing
a good deal of it, others practically none at all.
Turning again to the head, we find the eyes small
and dark coloured, while the so-called "whiskers"
are long, stiff, and thick at the base. These long,
stiff hairs grow on the upper-lip, and there is a tuft
of them over each eye, and two tufts&mdash;one below
the other&mdash;on each cheek. In the case of the
domestic cat these "whiskers" are soft, and
possess a very delicate sense of touch, thus
enabling the animal to creep noiselessly through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">« 27 »</a></span>
undergrowth in pursuit of prey. Should the cat's
"whiskers" touch the grass or other growth on
each side, puss is then instinctively aware that there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">« 28 »</a></span>
is not sufficient room for her body to pass, and that
she will therefore make a rustling sound if she
persists in her advance, and so alarm her prey.
These soft hairs on the cat's face are quite adequate
for her purpose, because she hunts on land and
hates wet. Soaked with water the soft hairs would
droop and prove useless, and so it is for this reason
that the otter's "whiskers" have gradually
developed until now they are strong and stiff
in order to withstand the exigencies of frequent
underwater journeys. They are used, too, in a
rather different way, for although while on land
they may aid the otter to make a quiet approach
on prey, their chief purpose is for locating
food&mdash;in the shape of frogs, fish, etc.&mdash;either
beneath stones, or on the bottom of the riverbed.
The long hairs on the otter's upper-lip
are susceptible of considerable movement, for their
development has been followed by that of the
muscles beneath, which give the puffy appearance
to the otter's face. Provided with perfect interdigital
webs on all four feet, the otter when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">« 29 »</a></span>
swimming slowly, paddles in exactly the same
manner as a dog. When the speed is increased,
however, the tail is brought into action, being
moved from side to side, while the body is thrown
into sinuous curves.</p>

OTTER'S HEAD, SHOWING WHITE MARKINGS ABOUT THE MOUTH
AND THROAT.</div>
</div>

<p>The otter, like the seal, feeds upon fish, but
whereas the seal swallows its prey whole and
entire, the otter masticates its food. The teeth of
the otter are therefore adapted to crushing bones,
which, if not thoroughly broken up, would lodge
in the animal's throat. The two back teeth in the
otter's upper jaw are considerably enlarged, and
are provided with cutting edges and a flat crushing
surface. Provided with a short and powerful jaw,
armed with a formidable array of teeth, the otter is
capable of inflicting a very nasty bite, as many a
hound and terrier, as well as otter-hunter, has had
cause to remember. Luckily the otter is a clean-feeding
animal, and the after results of a bite are
usually not serious.</p>

<p>In the matter of size and weight, otters vary
considerably, those found on or near the sea
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">« 30 »</a></span>
coast being usually heavier than otters frequenting
inland waters. No doubt the quantity and quality
of the food supply has a good deal to do with the
variation. Roughly speaking, the average weight
of a dog otter is from 20 lb. to 24 lb., and of a bitch,
16 lb. to 20 lb. As far as record weights are
concerned, Daniel mentions an otter taken in the
river Lea in October, 1794, which scaled "upwards
of 40 lb." Turning to a more reliable source of
information, however, we find in the <i>Field</i> of
July 5th, 1919, a list of the lengths and weights of
eleven large otters killed in Norfolk. I take the
liberty of quoting the particulars which are as
follows:</p>

<p>Males, 48 inches, 37 lb.; 53&frac12; inches, 30 lb.;
50&frac12; inches, 28 lb.; 53 inches, 27 lb.; 50 inches,
27 lb.; 50 inches, 23 lb.; 48 inches, 23 lb.; 49
inches, 18&frac12; lb.</p>

<p>Females, 46 inches, 16 lb.; 43 inches, 16 lb.;
44 inches, 14 lb.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the above how extremely
weight varies in relation to measurement. Bitch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">« 31 »</a></span>
otters occasionally weigh far heavier than any
of those mentioned in the foregoing list.</p>

<p>In the <i>Field</i> of September 22nd, 1917, an old
record is given (March, 1813) of a large bitch otter
trapped near Leven's Hall, Westmorland,
measuring 54 inches, and weighing 27&frac34; lb. The
record otter killed by hounds, a dog otter of 34
lb., was accounted for by the Essex O.H. on
July 10th, 1907, during Mr Rose's mastership of
that pack. This otter was found in the sea
marshes near Ipswich. Generally speaking, very
few otters of 30 lb. or over are accounted for by
hounds.</p>

<p>It appears to be a matter of uncertainty as to
how long a bitch otter goes with young. We have
heard it said nine weeks, but have no reliable
evidence to go by. As to the number of cubs in
a litter, two appear to be more often laid down than
three, although five have been more than once
found in the same couch. Roughly speaking,
the average number appears to be from two to
three.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">« 32 »</a></span></p>

<p>As to how many years an otter in a wild state
will live, it is practically impossible to say. We
have seen otters killed by hounds, whose general
appearance and state of their teeth pointed to the
fact that they had arrived at a ripe old age. Otter
cubs of similar age have been found in every month
of the year, thus exploding the old supposition
that otters bred only in spring. Young bitch
otters appear to pair as soon as they arrive at
maturity, thus cubs are produced as above stated.</p>

<p>Otters of abnormal colour make their appearance
from time to time. In the Badminnten volume on
"Hunting," there is an account of a cream-coloured
otter killed on the West Dart, while in "A Fauna
of Argyll" by Harvie-Brown and Buckley, there
is mention of a pure white otter which was killed
in Jura.</p>

<p>Although a clean-feeding animal, the otter is
a creature one hardly associates with human food.
For all that the heart and other portions of an
otter's anatomy have been served up at table on
several occasions ere now, presumably we suppose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">« 33 »</a></span>
for experimental purposes. Which reminds us of
the yarn concerning the old trapper, who when
asked if he had ever eaten turkey-buzzard, replied
"Yes, siree, I <i>have</i> eaten turkey-buzzard, but
I don't <i>hanker</i> after it." On one occasion we
became possessed of a dead otter, whose carcass,
after skinning, we presented to two dogs. The
latter promptly turned up their noses at it, whereas
several cats to which it was afterwards given set
about devouring it quite keenly. In the case of
hounds, unless the carcass of their quarry is still
warm and they are excited by the free use of horn
and voice, they will show no great desire to do
more than tear the body of an otter.</p>

<p>The otter's hide&mdash;covering a sinuous body, with
loosely articulated limbs&mdash;is tough, and offers more
resistance to hounds' teeth than the skin of a fox,
which soon disintegrates when worried by the
pack. As far as hounds are concerned, the scent
of an otter must at times be to them exceedingly
strong, yet to the human nose&mdash;even if the latter
is held close to the animal's body&mdash;there is only a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">« 34 »</a></span>
faint and not unpleasant odour, very different to
the rank scent of a fox.</p>

<p>As previously mentioned, there appears to be
considerable uncertainty as to how long the bitch
otter goes with young. In the "Master of
Game," the oldest and most important work on
the chase in the English language, written between
the years 1406 and 1413 by Edward III.'s grandson
Edward, second Duke of York, there is a short
chapter on "The Otter and His Nature," in which
it says that the otter bears her young as long as
the ferret does. This chapter is of great interest,
both as regards the knowledge of venery possessed
by mediaeval hunters, and the quaint wording of
the letterpress. For this reason we take the
liberty of quoting it in full. It says, "An otter is
a common beast enough and therefore I need not
tell of his making. She liveth with (on?) fish and
dwelleth by rivers and by ponds and stanks (pools).
And sometimes she feedeth on grass of the
meadows and hideth gladly under the roots of trees
near the rivers, and goeth to her feeding as doth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">« 35 »</a></span>
other beasts to grass, but only in the new grass
time, and to fish as I have said. They swimmeth
in waters and rivers and sometimes diveth under
the water when they will, and therefore no fish can
escape them unless it be too great a one. They
doth great harm specially in ponds and stanks,
for a couple of otters without more shall well
destroy the fish of a great pond or great stank, and
therefore men hunt them. They go in their love
at the time that ferrets do, so they that hold (keep)
ferrets in their houses may well know the time
thereof. They bear their whelps as long as the
ferrets and sometimes more and sometimes less.
They whelp in holes under the trees near the
rivers. Men hunt at them with hounds by great
mastery, as I say hereafter.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> And also men take
them at other times in rivers with small cords as
men do the fox with nets and with other gins. She
hath an evil biting and venomous and with her
strength defendeth herself mightily from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">« 36 »</a></span>
hounds. And when she is taken with nets unless
men get to her at once she rendeth them with her
teeth and delivereth herself out of them. Longer
will I not make mention of her, nor of her nature,
for the hunting at her is the best that men may see
of her, save only that she has the foot of a goose,
for she hath a little skin from one claw to another,
and she hath no heel save that she hath a little
lump under the foot, and men speak of the steps
or the marches of the otter as men speak of the
trace of the hart, and his fumes (excrements)
tredeles or spraints. The otter dwelleth but little
in one place, for where she goeth the fish be sore
afraid. Sometimes she will swim upwards and
downwards seeking the fish a mile or two unless it
be in a stank.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The author of "Master of Game" does not say anything
more about the otter.</p></div>

<p>"Of the remnant of his nature I refer to
Milbourne<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the king's otter-hunter."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The Milbourne referred to by the Duke of York can
scarcely be any other than the William Melbourne we find
mentioned in Henry IV's reign as "Valet of our Otterhounds"
(note in appendix to "Master of Game").</p></div>

<p>If otters "bear their whelps as long as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">« 37 »</a></span>
ferrets," the period of gestation is six weeks or
forty-five days. Bitch ferrets come in heat in
April or May, and unless mated some of them
apparently remain more or less in that condition
during the summer months.</p>

<p>The excrement of the otter, known in hunting
parlance as "spraints," "wedging," or "coke," is
usually of a blackish colour, and contains the bones
and scales of fish. Sometimes it shows the
remains of fur or feather, which is proof positive
that the otter does not live entirely upon a fish diet.</p>

<p>Where an otter has been feeding on frogs, the
coke is usually a yellowish colour. In sand or soft
earth an otter will scrape the latter into a small
mound, like a cat, and for the same purpose.</p>

<p>Coke is generally found on stones in midstream,
or at points where the otter enters or leaves the
water. A small grassy promontory is a favourite
place, and at such spots the grass often grows
particularly green. If the grass is long, the coke
will be found hidden amongst it. It is popularly
supposed that the direction in which an otter is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">« 38 »</a></span>
travelling&mdash;up or down stream&mdash;can be verified
by the position in which the coke is left on the
stones. In our experience there is little reliability
about this theory. On a rock in midstream the
position of the coke is quite as likely to be in the
centre as at the sides, particularly if there is a tuft
of grass or other growth on the stone.</p>

<p>An otter is quite likely to turn round, just as
a cat or dog does, prior to depositing the coke,
therefore the position of the latter can hardly be a
reliable guide as to the direction taken by the
animal when it eventually moves off.</p>

<p>Owing to being the possessor of a webbed foot,
with five toes and short claws, the otter leaves a
track&mdash;in hunting parlance "spur," "seal," or
"mark,"&mdash;entirely different from that of any other
animal to be met with in this country. Amongst
the general literature relating to the otter, we have
found small reference to the animal's footprints,
while in some cases the information on the subject
was incorrect. For instance in one article we
read, it states "No other creature, saving a cat,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">« 39 »</a></span>
leaves such a print on Nature's page as does an
otter. Four round small toes and, if the soil be
favourable, a plain triangle just behind where the
webbing of the foot has rested."</p>

<p>Now an otter&mdash;like the badger, stoat, weasel,
and hedgehog&mdash;has five toes on each foot, and the
marks of the claws or nails are always visible in
the footprints. A cat has four toes, armed with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">« 40 »</a></span>
retractile claws, the marks of which are not shown
on the ground, except when the animal is about
to make a spring. Although a cat track may
approximate in size to that of an otter cub, the
latter always shows claw-marks, and partial if not
entire imprints of five toes. On hard ground,
claw-marks will show when the impression of the
rest of the foot is practically invisible, so anyone
with a knowledge of woodcraft can hardly mistake
the track of a cat for that of an otter cub. In the
same way with the footprints of hounds, terriers,
or other dogs, their tracks all show the imprints of
four toes, plus the marks of the claws. A terrier's
track is far more like that of a fox than an otter,
while hounds leave large footprints, easy to
distinguish.</p>

<p>We have also seen it stated that the track of an
otter is "recognisable by the mark of its five toes,
and the absence of a heel." Under certain
conditions this is true enough, but on favourable
ground the mark of the heel is plainly visible.
In like manner an impression of the webbing is
sometimes left. In snow of fair depth, the
individual tracks of an otter are more or less
obliterated by the drag of the animal's body, which
leaves a furrow as if a miniature snow-plough had
been at work. Also in snow the drag of the otter's
tail&mdash;in hunting parlance "rudder" or "pole"&mdash;is
generally to be seen.</p>

<p>The otter has three gaits: walking, jumping,
and galloping. The walk shows a line&mdash;usually
rather twisting&mdash;of footprints one behind the other.
When jumping the tracks appear in pairs, with an
interval between each pair. At this gait the
imprints of the hind feet cover the tracks made by
the forefeet. At the gallop, which is really jumping
at top speed, the hind feet are thrown ahead
of the forefeet.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE OTTER'S HAUNTS AND HABITS</span></p>


<p>As mentioned in the previous chapter, otter cubs
may be born in any month of the year. Prior to
laying down her young, the bitch otter selects a
couch in the vicinity of good feeding ground.
Her choice of a retreat will vary with the locality
in which she happens to be at the time. In the
low country her cubs may be laid down in a dry
drain in the meadows, where frogs are plentiful,
and the ditches contain a supply of eels, or amongst
the brushwood in some large covert, where the
ground is swampy, and through which one or two
small runners meander on their way to join the
parent stream. In the north, where the rivers are
swift and rocky, the cubs may first see the light of
day in some cairn or pile of boulders, situated high
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">« 43 »</a></span>
up near the source of the stream, or in some rocky
earth adjacent to a mountain tarn. On the grouse
moor they may be found in some sod drain or other
hiding-place amongst the peat and heather, near
a pool or pools containing fish, and frequented by
wildfowl as well as frogs and such small deer.</p>

<p>Quite small cubs are often found in holts in the
bank of a main river, but it is pretty safe to say
that the majority of bitch otters move up-stream,
either to the head-waters, or up some side-runner
prior to laying down their cubs. The latter have
on various occasions been discovered actually
beneath, or in close proximity to human habitations.</p>

<p>In the <i>Field</i> of October 29th, 1921, there is an
interesting description of such an occurrence, which
we take the liberty of quoting. It says: "An odd
experience is recorded to have happened in the
year 1790 to Mr William Bethel, the then owner
of Watton, and a guest. He and a clergyman
were sitting quietly at dinner, when they were
surprised by an extraordinary noise beneath the
dining-table for which they could not account, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">« 44 »</a></span>
at length they were so much annoyed by it that
they sent for a workman to take up the floor, when
to their great astonishment they found that an otter
which had inhabited the moat had established her
nest beneath the boards of the floor, and had there
deposited her litter of young ones, by whose
uncouth cries it was that the dinner-party had been
disturbed."</p>

<p>In <i>The Gamekeeper</i> for May, 1914, there is
another interesting account of a somewhat similar
nature. It says: "On March 13th last, Mr
Colwill, a tenant on the Trebartha Estate, Cornwall,
lost a lamb, and there being a mouth of a
large drain in the field, thought perhaps there
might be a chance of the lamb having gone up the
drain. Getting a long stick he put it up the drain,
and feeling something move he thought it must be
the lamb, but on turning round, saw the lamb
coming up the field towards him. The same
evening he put some lambs in the shippen in front
of some cows, putting them on some hay. Before
going to bed he went to see that the lambs were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">« 45 »</a></span>
all right. He was just hanging up his lamp, when
something&mdash;he could not see what&mdash;rushed out
past him. When he went to look at his lamb, he
found a young otter lying with the lamb."</p>

<p>The account goes on to say that on the particular
night in question, the local rivers were in flood.
The above seems to point to the fact that the bitch
otter had been flooded out of the drain, and had
carried her cub to the shelter of the shippen. A
photograph of the lamb and the otter cub was
reproduced in conjunction with the above letterpress.</p>

<p>Otter cubs, like young foxes, are born blind.
Fox cubs remain so for a period of about three
weeks, and it is probable that a similar length of
time, or perhaps rather more, elapses ere young
otters can see. In the <i>Field</i> of November 26th,
1921, there is an account of an otter cub whose
mother was inadvertently killed by hounds. This
cub was rescued and brought up by hand. When
taken from the holt its age was estimated at
fourteen days. Sixteen days later the cub opened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">« 46 »</a></span>
its eyes, thus a period of thirty days elapsed from
the time of its birth until it could see. At the end
of the thirty days the cub weighed 14 ounces. It
was at first fed on milk and water, but became very
thin on this diet, so a change was made to
"Mellins" as mixed for a new-born child. On
this the cub thrived, its weight on October 11th
being just under 2 lb. It was taken from the holt
on August 20th. Had this cub been fed in the
ordinary way by its mother it would possibly have
opened its eyes at a rather earlier date, as it would
have escaped the set-back caused by an unsuitable
diet. The eyes of the adult otter are very dark
coloured, but those of a cub are at first much
lighter, not unlike the eyes of a young fox cub.</p>

<p>When the cubs are able to travel, the bitch otter
leads them down from the head-waters to the larger
streams. The cubs remain with their mother for
some considerable time, as witness the constant
occurrence of cubs of from 10 lb. to 12 lb. being
put down in company with the bitch. They
consort with their mother until she goes off to rear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">« 47 »</a></span>
another family, when they are then left to fend for
themselves. From this it is apparent that the otter
has but one litter per year.</p>

<p>There is a great deal yet to be learnt about the
otter, for, being more or less a creature of the night,
and elusive in its movements, it is extremely
difficult to study systematically. Otter cubs,
although somewhat delicate, are not difficult to
hand-rear, and make very interesting and tractable
pets. If healthy to start with, cows' milk diluted
with water is at first a satisfactory diet. Both
cubs and adult otters are of course easy enough to
study in captivity, but like many other creatures
confined under similar conditions, they soon
exhibit certain abnormal tastes and habits, and
therefore afford little or no real clue to their
behaviour in their natural habitat. At the
Zoological Gardens in London, the otters will eat
almost anything thrown to them by visitors.</p>

<p>The bitch otter shows great affection for her
young, and will hang about in their vicinity in the
face of hounds or human intruders. If a bitch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">« 48 »</a></span>
with cubs is killed, the cubs, if well grown, will
search the vicinity for their parent, the same
applying to one of a pair which has been caught
in a trap, its mate remaining near it all night in an
attempt to get it away. On these occasions the
otters make a considerable noise, blowing and
snorting in their agitation. On one occasion some
years ago, a brother of ours found three small otter
cubs on a Yorkshire beck, which he eventually
captured. The bitch otter remained close at hand,
making a great fuss, regardless of any possible
danger to herself. The cubs were carried home,
a distance of a mile or more, but were returned
within a short time to the pool where they
were found. The bitch otter again made her
appearance, and eventually went off with her
restored family.</p>

<p>Otters, being great nomads, wander long
distances up and down our rivers, frequently
crossing high watersheds, and travelling far across
country. Having no fixed abode like the fox, the
otter inhabits temporary retreats or holts during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">« 49 »</a></span>
the course of his journeyings. Most of these holts
have been used by generations of otters, and many
a drain or other shelter long forgotten by the
people of the neighbourhood is still regularly
inhabited by <i>Lutra</i> and his kind. A holt may
consist of a tree-root on the river-bank, a dry drain,
or a wet one containing a dry lying place, a stick-heap
near the stream, or situated in a plantation at
some distance from the water. On the rocky
rivers of the North, many of the holts consist of
piled-up boulders on the hill-side, most of which
are at some distance from the nearest beck or
tarn. These rock-holts, many of which lie at a
high altitude, are occupied by otters when crossing
from stream to stream over a watershed. In
summer, otters frequently "lie rough," or in other
words spend the day above ground. Near a lake
or tarn an otter will often curl up in the rushes or
long grass at the water's edge. If disturbed he
will then slide quietly into the pool, and unless
hunted by hounds, will not show himself again.
Sometimes he will lie on a bank or in a hedge close
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">« 50 »</a></span>
to the mouth of a drain, the latter serving him as
a safe retreat when danger threatens. In fact,
during the warm weather, otters are found lying
rough in all sorts of unexpected places, often to
the great surprise of those who fondly imagine
that the animals never leave the vicinity of water.</p>

<p>Certain tree-roots and also rock-holts have their
entrances under water. In some of them there
cannot be any great amount of ventilation. An
otter cannot live without air, yet presumably it can
exist with less than most creatures. Otter cubs are
sometimes laid down in holts of the above nature,
where there is no ventilation shaft, and we have
heard the theory expressed that under such
conditions practically all the fresh air that the cubs
get is carried in to them in their mother's coat.
In our experience, however, even though a holt
has an underwater entrance, there are usually
plenty of air passages coming down from above,
at any rate, sufficient to supply a more than
adequate amount of fresh air for breathing
purposes. The advantage of an underwater
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">« 51 »</a></span>
entrance to an otter lies in the fact that he can
get in and out without showing himself, and once
inside he may be "out of mark," or in other words,
his scent is not carried to the outer air, so that if
hounds come along they cannot wind him in his
retreat.</p>

<p>After his night's peregrinations, an otter will
return to his holt, but prior to settling down in his
chosen retreat, he often visits one or two other
tree-roots on the river-bank. Hounds sometimes
mark at these places, only to find that their otter
has gone on.</p>

<p>Along the sea coast, otters inhabit the water-worn
caves and other retreats about the cliffs.
Wherever there is an open boathouse on lake or
river, otters are pretty sure to resort to it. We
have examined many such places, and almost
invariably found otter coke lying about on the
planking, and sometimes actually in a boat or
boats. In bad weather a boathouse affords a dry
lying spot, and no doubt this is why otters visit it.</p>

<p>In order to thoroughly realise the wanderings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">« 52 »</a></span>
and often long cross-country journeys undertaken
by otters, one must track them in the snow. On
one occasion such a trail led us for a good ten
miles overland, the otter having left a stream,
and made his way uphill via a small runner. The
latter petered out in the open ground, but the trail
led on in the direction of a frozen reservoir.
Round this the otter had gone, then he followed
the stream from the outlet for some distance, after
which he turned straight across country. Three
or four big stone walls had then intervened, but
the otter&mdash;which had probably been over the same
route before&mdash;made straight to certain smoots, and
passed through with no unnecessary searching for
a way out. He then visited a small lake, also
frozen, and again took to the outlet stream, down
which he went until he arrived at the main river.
It must have been a pretty hard trip for so short-legged
an animal, for the otter left a furrow in
the snow which was quite deep. From the point
where he left the stream where we picked up his
tracks, to the spot where the trail entered the main
river in the next dale across the watershed, the
otter had not stopped once, but had kept toddling
on. In the Lake District, otters regularly travel
the passes over the hills, visiting the mountain
tarns, and going from one dale to another.</p>

<p>Otters are playful beasts, a favourite game of
theirs being sliding. They choose a steep clay
bank, or a smooth snow slope, and toboggan down
it on their stomachs with evident enjoyment.
Although one seldom sees these slides in this
country, they are very common in Canada where
we have often come across them. During the cold
weather of a Canadian winter, otters spend a good
deal of their time beneath the ice, being able to
breathe at the air-spaces round the shore. These
air-spaces are left when the water lowers after the
ice is formed.</p>

<p>Concerning the otter's feeding habits, there
appears to be a good deal of misconception.
Some people imagine that the otter exists entirely
on fish, and for this reason should be done to death
as a river-poacher at every opportunity. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">« 54 »</a></span>
have in the previous chapter compared the teeth
of the otter and the seal, the latter animal swallowing
its food whole, while the former masticates its
food. Seals live upon fish, but it must be
remembered that the otter belongs to the marten
family, and, though well adapted to lead an aquatic
existence, it still retains some of the marten's
hunting instincts, and its teeth are suited to seizing
and holding both furred and feathered prey. The
pine marten, stoat, and weasel will all eat trout
greedily when they can get it, so it is only natural
that the otter, their relation, well equipped for
swimming and water work, should show the same
taste. As a matter of fact he <i>does</i> exhibit the same
taste as his smaller relatives, and to a much greater
degree, but he is also glad to vary his diet and add
both flesh and fowl to the menu.</p>

<p>The uninitiated, whose knowledge of otters has
been gained by visits to the Zoological Gardens,
while realising the swimming ability of the animals,
look upon them as clumsy beasts on land, and ill-adapted
to lead an active existence on terra firma.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">« 55 »</a></span>
In an article comparing the badger and the otter,
it says, "The otter, on the other hand, though an
expert swimmer, is on land nearly as clumsy as his
cousin the badger." The author of the said article
can have done little or no otter-hunting, for if he
had, he would never have made such a foolish
statement. Despite his webbed feet, the otter
is built like the weasels, and exhibits a great deal
of their activity and quickness on land. For this
reason he is well able to cope with furred and
feathered quarry.</p>

<p>Beginning the otter's menu with fish, we find he
eats salmon, sea trout, trout, and coarse fish. On
the west of Scotland and in the Hebrides, otters
live a good deal on the coast, but in the autumn
they follow the salmon up the streams. Where
salmon are plentiful and easily secured, otters kill
a fish, take it ashore, and eat a portion of the
shoulder only. In the old days in the Highlands,
when otters were more numerous than they are at
present, the crofters used regularly to visit the
otters' landing places, in order to gather the salmon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">« 56 »</a></span>
left there. The marks on such fish were known
as the "otter's bite." In that delightful book,
"Wild Sports of the Highlands" by Charles St
John, the author refers to the above practice as
follows: "I was rather amused at an old woman
living at Sluie, on the Findhorn, who, complaining
of the hardness of the present times, when 'a
puir body couldna' get a drop smuggled whisky,
or shot a rae without his lordship's sportsman
finding it out,' added to her list of grievances that
even the otters were nearly all gone, 'puir beasties.'
'Well, but what good could the otters do you?' I
asked her. 'Good, your honour? Why scarcely
a morn came but they left a bonny grilse on the
scarp down yonder, and the <i>vennison</i> was none the
waur of the bit, the puir beasts eat themselves.'
The people here call every eatable animal, fish,
flesh, or fowl, venison, or as they pronounce it
'vennison.' For instance they tell you that the
snipes are 'good vennison,' or that the trout are
not good 'vennison' in the winter."</p>

<p>Although an otter is a capable swimmer, he cannot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">« 57 »</a></span>
travel half as fast as a salmon under water.
In low water a single otter can tire out or corner a
salmon in a pool, but evidence leads us to believe
that otters often work together, one driving the
salmon about, while the other keeps watch on the
shallows. On all rivers there are places where fish
can be more or less cornered when the water is at
normal level, and of course when it is very low in
time of drought, salmon and other fish are practically
pool-bound, and thus fall victims to otters
and other predaceous creatures. It is pretty safe
to say that an otter&mdash;like a pike, or a cannibal
trout&mdash;will go for any fish which appears to be
weak or in difficulty. A spinning lure&mdash;such as
a spoon that wobbles instead of turning truly&mdash;is
often far more attractive than one that spins "like
a streak of silver."</p>

<p>In the <i>Field</i> of June 5th, 1920, there is an
account of an otter attacking a hooked salmon.
The writer of the account says, "While I was playing
a salmon on the Teify on Friday, May 21st,
an otter made two attempts to get at him, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">« 58 »</a></span>
very nearly succeeded once. This seems so
unusual to me that it would be of great interest
if others have had a similar experience. This
incident took place about eight in the evening, and
in a pool where there was only an opening of a
few feet where one could gaff the fish owing to
trees. The trees undoubtedly accounted for the
otter failing to see me, but as soon as he raised his
head above water in midstream and saw that there
were others as well as himself after that fish he soon
cleared off, and the fish was successfully landed.
The wild rushes made by the salmon after the otter's
first attempt were extraordinary, as the fish was
about done and fit for gaffing. To me this was a
clear proof of the instinctive fear and wonderful
vitality in a fish when his natural enemy appeared."</p>

<p>Other instances of a similar nature have been
recorded from time to time, in some of which the
otter has succeeded in taking the hooked fish.
There is no doubt that an otter or otters frighten
fish, particularly salmon, when chasing them about
a pool. The instinct of all wild animals is to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">« 59 »</a></span>
attack a weakly or wounded creature, even if
belonging to their own kind, and the otter which
goes for a hooked salmon does so because he knows
he stands a better chance of catching it than other
fish in the same pool which are free and
untrammelled.</p>

<p>The otter must, therefore, do considerable good
by ridding the streams of weak and sickly fish.
An otter deals with large sea trout as it does with
salmon, but in the case of trout it frequently eats
them entire, leaving nothing to waste. When
devouring fish an otter eats like a cat, with half-closed
eyes. In the case of coarse fish, the otter
often discards the head and tail, and in the same
way with an eel, the head may be left. Those
who decry the otter as a fish-poacher should
remember that the animal does not confine his
attentions solely to one pool or to one species of
diet during his nightly wanderings. He may fish
and otherwise feed up-stream for some miles,
taking a trout here, an eel there, and perhaps a
young rabbit somewhere else.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">« 60 »</a></span></p>

<p>We have already seen that the otter must do
good by killing sickly or wounded salmon, and in
the same way with trout, he captures many an old
cannibal fish which is far better out of the water.
These old trout not only prey on their own smaller
relations, but are great devourers of fish spawn, and
the same applies, only in a much greater degree,
to eels, which are the worst vermin in or about a
river or lake. Many coarse fish, too, are inimical
to spawn and young fry, therefore the otter does
far more good than harm by feeding on them.
Eels and frogs, the latter being skinned by an
otter, are the first quarry that the bitch otter
teaches her cubs to hunt. These are sought for
on land and in the wet ditches and shallow runners.
Later, the cubs are initiated in the art of fishing.</p>

<p>When first introduced to water, the cubs show
considerable reluctance to swim. This can hardly
be because they are unable to do so, but rather
owing to a youthful aversion&mdash;as in the case of a
puppy&mdash;to entering a strange element for the first
time. The bitch therefore takes them to a stone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">« 61 »</a></span>
in midstream, and either pushes them in, or leaves
them there until they are at last tempted to enter
the water and follow her. On the sea coast otters
spend a good deal of time searching for flounders in
the shallow pools. They also eat crabs, lobsters,
sea anemones, and various crustaceans. Otters
sometimes visit the lobster fishers' creels, and there
are instances on record of partially grown otters
having been found drowned in the creels. On
inland lakes and streams otters feed on fresh-water
mussels and cray-fish.</p>

<p>As previously mentioned, it is no uncommon
thing to find the remains of fur and feather in
otter coke. Otters capture waterhens and dabchicks,
although we are of the opinion that they
prefer other food if they can get it. At any rate
we are familiar with a certain reed-fringed pond
on the hills, where a bitch otter and two cubs
of about 12 lb. weight resided for some months.
This pond was also occupied by quite a number
of waterhens, yet there were no apparent remains
of these birds to be found in the vicinity, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">« 62 »</a></span>
pointed to the fact that the otters left them pretty
much alone.</p>

<p>A rather curious thing happened when we visited
the pond with hounds. At first the waterhens were
much in evidence, but after hounds had been at
work for an hour or two, we began to find dead
waterhens lying about. These were not killed by
hounds, but were drowned, and had practically&mdash;as
far as we could see&mdash;committed suicide. To
escape danger a waterhen will keep diving, and
the birds under discussion had evidently&mdash;owing
to the continual presence of hounds&mdash;done so until
they were tired out, and subsequently perished
under water. What made their behaviour stranger
still was the fact that there was a small covert
adjoining the pond, in which the birds could have
found sanctuary on terra firma until all danger was
past.</p>

<p>Both dabchicks and waterhens devour fish
spawn, so otters do good by thinning out the ranks
of these birds. At times otters will take game-birds,
and there are authentic records of grouse,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">« 63 »</a></span>
pheasants, and duck having been killed by them.
One or two instances of this will suffice. In "The
Natural History of Sport in Scotland," by Tom
Speedy, the latter says: "That he can scent and
pounce upon his prey like a fox was demonstrated
by following his tracks among snow up Corrie
Macshee Burn at Dalnaspidal. The trail left the
water-side and showed where the animal had made
a bound and caught a grouse in its roosting-place
among the snow. Returning to the stream, he had
crossed on to a boulder in the centre of the burn,
where he devoured part of his prey." The same
author mentions a case of an otter on the Biel
estate in East Lothian, which dragged a foster-mother
hen out of a coop and partly devoured it,
as well as a number of young pheasants big enough
to sit out amongst the grass. Traps were set,
baited with the dead bodies of the birds, and a large
otter was secured; the massacre then ceased.</p>

<p>In <i>The Gamekeeper</i> for August, 1913, there is
a note concerning the deaths of fifteen sitting
pheasants in a covert beside a river. Each bird
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">« 64 »</a></span>
had a hole gnawed down through the back, the
carcasses being left lying near the nests, not an
egg having been touched. A duck caught on her
nest is treated in the same way by an otter. In
<i>The Gamekeeper</i> for June, 1919, there is a note
concerning an otter which was caught in a tunnel-trap
baited with rabbit paunch. The trap was set
in the middle of a one hundred acre wood. The
otter was a cub, weighing 9&frac12; lb.</p>

<p>Waterhens and dabchicks, particularly the latter,
when taken by otters, are pulled under the water,
though they may be captured amongst the reeds
and other undergrowth as well. Ducklings sometimes
fall victims to the otter, though as a rule big
pike do the greatest harm in this direction. Pike
have been known to take pheasants as well as duck
which had fallen into a lake during the course of a
shoot. From available evidence, otters on a
stream containing trout and coarse fish seem to
prefer the latter. Possibly they are easier to
capture than trout. On hill-streams, where the fish
are small but very numerous owing to shortage of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">« 65 »</a></span>
food, otters must do a great deal of good by reducing
the stock.</p>

<p>As far as furred prey is concerned, otters will
kill and eat rats, water-voles, and young rabbits.
We have on several occasions seen where a small
bunny had been caught by an otter. On marshes
where duck shooting is carried on, otters find and
feed on wounded duck, exactly as do foxes. Here
again they do good by acting as scavengers, as
well as by putting winged birds out of their misery.
Rabbits appear to be the largest four-footed
creatures preyed upon by otters, but we have heard
it suggested by an old Lakeland dalesman that they
will on occasion take lambs. Although we bring
forward this suggestion with great diffidence, it is
quite possible that there is some truth in it. Our
informant lived by the shore of a lake in an out-of-the-way
part of the country, where at one time
pine-martens were very plentiful. It is a well-known
fact that martens will kill lambs, and an
otter, which is a much more powerful animal, could
easily do the same if so inclined. Anyway, the old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">« 66 »</a></span>
dalesman more than once found the carcass of a
lamb left close to the edge of the water on the
lake shore, with the tracks of otters round about
it. Neither a hill-fox nor marten would be likely
to drag or carry the carcass to water, and the whole
thing certainly pointed to the work of otters.</p>

<p>An otter is a predaceous animal of the weasel
family, strong, and active in its habits, and would
experience no difficulty in tackling a lamb. It is
never safe to be dogmatic in one's statements concerning
the habits of wild creatures, because
generally speaking, the only regular thing about
them is their variability. Cases have occurred
where otters were responsible for killing ducks,
grouse, pheasants, and rabbits, and though such
behaviour is only occasional on the part of the
average otter, it shows what he will do when so
inclined.</p>

<p>In winter otters are sometimes hard put to it to
find food, and they have been known to take
poultry at such times. In the same way regarding
the dalesman's statement about lambs, an otter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">« 67 »</a></span>
<i>may</i> occasionally kill one, although most people
would laugh at such an idea. We know that hill-foxes
take lambs, having scores of times found
carcasses in and about the earths, yet one meets
hunting people who resolutely refuse to believe
that Reynard ever falls so far from grace as to
feed on lamb. A fox will eat trout when he can
get it, and so will many dogs. We have one now
which eats small trout as greedily as a cat, and no
doubt foxes secure many fish when the hill-streams
are dead low in summer. It is no more strange
for a fox or a dog to eat fish than for an otter to
take an occasional lamb. All three are carnivorous&mdash;the
otter being least so&mdash;and when all is said
and done, wild animals show very unusual traits at
times.</p>

<p>Summing up the otter's feeding habits, we find
he kills fish, and in the case of salmon he is
certainly wasteful. To set against this he takes
many a sickly fish, as well as cannibal trout, all
of which are better out of the way. He kills
waterhens and dabchicks, both devourers of fish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">« 68 »</a></span>
spawn, and he slays quantities of eels, which are
the worst vermin to be found in lake or stream.
Game is only an occasional item on his menu, and
nobody grudges him a few young rabbits.</p>

<p>Otters, therefore, if kept within reasonable limits,
do their share of good, and, like the fox, provide the
very best of sport when hunted. When Reynard is
rolled over by hounds it is the debt he pays for
the privileged existence of himself and his kind,
and the same thing applies to the otter. Given a
good pack of hounds, hunting their district
properly, otters will be kept sufficiently in check,
and good sport will be enjoyed by riparian owners
and others.</p>

<p>The only occasion on which an otter can do
really extensive damage is when he gets access to
a trout hatchery. Once he finds his way to the
breeding ponds he will kill fish right and left. If,
however, such places are properly fenced off&mdash;as
they should be&mdash;they will never suffer from the
attentions of otters. Swans and other wildfowl,
herons, dabchicks, waterhens, kingfishers, frogs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">« 69 »</a></span>
cannibal trout, and eels do far more damage to fish
and fish spawn than otters, and with the exception
of certain wildfowl, provide no sport in return.
The otter, like the fly-fisherman, is a sportsman,
and for this reason the one should deal leniently
with the other.</p>

<p>Otters do most of their feeding and travelling
at night, but it is not an uncommon occurrence
to find them abroad in daytime. In Canada we
have on several occasions seen them on the ice
during the day, and once while watching a deer
runway near a river, a big otter floated downstream
within twenty yards of us. Having fed
up-stream during the night, an otter may take to
some holt at the end of his journey, or he may
float down with the current&mdash;if the water is fairly
deep&mdash;and return to the holt from which he started.
Although an otter can make wonderful headway
against a strong current, he generally avoids rapids
and rough water when travelling up-stream. On
coming to such a place he lands, makes a detour,
and enters the water again higher up. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">« 70 »</a></span>
feeding expeditions are not necessarily restricted
to the main river, for he often explores side-streams,
ditches, and other places, which lie at
a considerable distance from deep water. He
usually leaves his holt&mdash;or couch if he is lying
rough&mdash;about dusk, and returns to it before
daybreak. For the most part otters are silent
creatures, but they whistle when calling to each
other, and will snort and blow when playing
together. In Canada their playgrounds are the
"slides," and there two otters will gambol like
puppies between the intervals of tobogganing down
the bank.</p>

<p>Although an otter does not dig to any extent,
he will, as already mentioned, scratch up sand or
soft earth for a certain purpose, and his feet and
claws aid him in securing crustaceans and other
food. Although the otter is unable to climb
like the marten, he can on occasion jump and
scramble over high places in a wonderful manner.
In the North, otters regularly travel deep ghylls
and watercourses where they are obliged to climb
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">« 71 »</a></span>
to some extent, and when hard pressed by hounds
it takes a very rough place indeed to stop an otter.
In big coverts an otter will stand up before hounds
like a fox, and will travel at a surprising pace.</p>

<p>On rough, rocky rivers, an otter's claws,
particularly those on the hind feet, are often very
much worn down. This may be accounted for by
the state of the going. A mounted specimen now
in our possession has the claws of the hind feet
practically worn off, whereas the nails on the
forefeet are nearly perfect.</p>

<p>There are probably few waters in Great Britain
which are not at some time or other haunted by
otters. Even in the vicinity of towns the marks
of otters may be found beside canals and streams,
the surroundings of which would appear to be
anything but attractive to <i>Lutra</i>. Being chiefly a
creature of the night, nomadic and elusive in its
habits, the otter often spends a peaceful existence
in the vicinity of human habitations, the occupants
of which never dream that the "sly, goose-footed
prowler" is a frequent visitor to their water. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">« 72 »</a></span>
majority of people have never seen an otter, except
under a glass case in some museum, or within the
confines of the Zoological Gardens. The angler,
fishing at dusk, may sometimes be favoured by a
glimpse of an otter, bent on the same errand as
himself, but as a rule few otters are seen except
when put down by hounds.</p>

<span class="smaller">OTTER-HUNTING, PAST AND PRESENT</span></p>


<p>It was not until a comparatively recent date, that
the otter became an accredited beast of chase. He
was hunted, after a fashion, from the very earliest
times, but the value of his skin&mdash;like that of the
fox&mdash;had more to do with his capture than the sport
he afforded.</p>

<p>King John of England appears to be the first
Master of Otterhounds of whom there is any
record, and Twici seems to have been the first
huntsman. In "The Master of Game," written
between the years 1406 and 1413, there is a
chapter on "The Otter and his Nature," illustrated
by a reproduction of an old illumination entitled
"Otter Hunting." This picture represents a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">« 74 »</a></span>
hound&mdash;apparently smooth-coated&mdash;swimming an
otter in a river. On the farther bank are two
hounds, and two men. One of the latter is
transfixing the otter as it swims with a long-handled,
three-pronged spear. The other man is
apparently about to throw a similar kind of spear
at the otter, while holding in his left hand a second
spear with the ordinary type of single-bladed head.
On the near bank are two more men, and two
hounds. One of the latter appears to be rough-coated,
or at any rate broken-haired, the other
being a large, white, smooth-coated animal. This
hound is evidently a limer, as it is held in leash by
one of the men. The other man, armed with a
single-bladed spear, is stabbing the otter in the
hindquarters.</p>

<p>It is apparent that in those early days the chief
use of the hounds was in finding the otter, and
once the latter was put down, the spears were
brought into play. In the chapter on the otter, it
says: "Men hunt at them with hounds by great
mastery," and "men take them at other times in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">« 75 »</a></span>
rivers with small cords as men do the fox with nets
and with other gins."</p>

<p>Thus we see plainly that the otter was little
thought of in those days, except for the value
afforded by his skin. In early times a lime-hound,
i.e., a hound held in leash, was used for harbouring
deer and other game. Such a hound was keen
and staunch, not too fast, and was taught to run
mute, in order not to disturb the game whose exact
whereabouts his master wished to discover. The
rope by which the hound was led was known as
a liam, being made of leather or silk. Both collar
and lead were often gaily coloured, and adorned
with silver.</p>

<p>The method of conducting the chase when
hunting at an otter "with hounds by great
mastery" was no doubt similar in some respects
to that practised at present. Instead, however,
of hunting the drag with the pack, lime-hounds
were used to locate the quarry, the latter being
then bolted by terriers. In the prologue to "The
Master of Game," it says with regard to dogs:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">« 76 »</a></span>
"And first I will begin with raches (running
hounds) and their nature, and then greyhounds and
their nature, and then alaunts and their nature,
and then spaniels and their nature, and then
mastiffs that men call curs and their nature, and
then of small curs that come to be terriers and
their nature." What these terriers were like
compared to the present-day breeds, it is difficult
to say, but no doubt they were hard-bitten animals,
well able to bolt otters or foxes.</p>

<p>Having bolted the otter, probably several
hounds were then uncoupled, which kept the
quarry on the move, so that the men got plenty
of chances to use their spears. The otter was
allowed no law as is now the custom, but was
transfixed at the first opportunity. The spears
were evidently thrown at the otter, as well as used
to transfix him on the shallows.</p>

<p>At a later date, in Somervile's days (1735) the
spear was in general use, and it is mentioned as late
as 1878 in the "Manual of British Rural Sports"
by Stonehenge. Turning to the "Otter Hunting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">« 77 »</a></span>
Diary" of the late Mr James Lomax, of Clayton
Hall, which dates from 1829 to 1871, we find no
mention of the spear. In "Field and Fern"
(South), by H. H. Dixon, published in 1865, there
is an account of Dr Grant, of Hawick, and his otterhounds,
without, however, any reference to spears.
Although the employment of the spear, or "otter-grains"
as it was sometimes called, was no doubt
almost universally discontinued fairly early in the
last century, it was probably used till a later date
by individuals who kept a hound or two, and
pursued otter, fox, and foumart after the manner
of the Scotch "tod-hunter" with his scratch pack.
Nets were sometimes used in conjunction with
spears to keep an otter from reaching tidal waters.</p>

<p>To-day, however, all such abominations have
been done away with, and now it is left for hounds
to hunt and kill their otter, if they can, unaided.
Until a few years ago, it was customary to meet
quite early in the morning, often soon after daybreak.
Nowadays, however, people are less
energetic, and it is nothing unusual to read of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">« 78 »</a></span>
fixtures as late as ten a.m. Although from a
social or "love and lunch" point of view, late
meets are no doubt convenient, the same can
hardly be said as regards hunting. Some Masters
of Otterhounds are averse to early meets because
they say that the drag is then often so strong that
hounds are very apt to pass over their otter. By
getting to the water later the drag has lost some of
its strength, and hounds are then brought to their
noses, and travel slower, thus being less inclined
to pass their otter in its holt. Really the time of
meeting should depend upon the character of the
water you intend to hunt. On a river flowing
through marsh or water meadows, where the long
grass and rushes are always more or less damp and
the ground beneath them shaded from the sun,
scent will lie for hours, and there is no necessity
to make a very early start. In the North, however,
where the streams are swift and rocky, and have
their sources far up the hill-sides, there is often
little shade, except beside some covert, or in some
ghyll or ravine to which the sun's rays seldom
penetrate. Meeting at ten o'clock on such water,
there is little chance of a good drag, and it may
mean hard work for both men and hounds before
they find, and eventually put their otter down.</p>

<p>Many an instance comes to mind, when if
hounds had been put to water three or four hours
earlier, they would have had a hot cross-country
drag, and probably a fine swimming hunt at the
end of it. We have known hounds meet at nine
o'clock at the foot of a Lakeland beck, and travel
several miles up-stream without a whimper. On
nearing the source, they spoke to a drag in the
depths of a shady ghyll, and carried it at a fast
pace out on to the open fell. There the sun was
beating down with tremendous power, and under
its influence the drag died out. Hounds were on
the line of a travelling otter, and had they hit off
the drag in the ghyll at five or six o'clock instead
of nine, they could easily have carried it over the
watershed, and down a runner which enters a tarn
in the next valley. A good hunt was thus spoilt,
simply because of a late start.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">« 80 »</a></span></p>

<p>An advantage of meeting early lies in the fact
that you perhaps find and kill your otter before
the real heat of the day begins, thus making things
easier for both hounds and field. It is impossible
to lay down any hard and fast rule as regards the
time of meeting, for as already mentioned, this
will be influenced by the character of the water you
are going to hunt, and, if you are dependent on
subscriptions, the keenness or otherwise of your
subscribers.</p>

<p>In the case of making a start with a newly
organised pack, containing a good proportion of
unentered hounds, it is advisable to get out early
in the morning until such time as your hounds
begin to understand their job and take an interest
in the business. Scent lies stronger both on land
and water during the early hours, and if your few
entered hounds find and mark their otter, the
unentered ones have a better chance when their
quarry is eventually put down.</p>

<p>To a lover of hound work, the drag left by an
otter during his nightly wanderings, provides as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">« 81 »</a></span>
much of interest when hounds can own it, as the
actual hunting after the otter is afloat. With
entered hounds which try the banks carefully it is
possible to find an otter without touching a drag
at all. This frequently happens after a late meet,
when the huntsman is a real trier, and can depend
on his hounds. Still, we imagine that the majority
of keen otter-hunters enjoy watching the pack at
work on a drag, and the music seems a fitting
prelude to the chorus that arises when finally
hounds mark and acknowledge in no uncertain
tones that their quarry is "at home."</p>

<p>Under favourable conditions the scent of an
otter will lie for a very long time. In the shade,
amidst tall herbage, or among the water lilies,
hounds can speak to it hours after their otter has
gone, and it is sometimes difficult to know whether
they are the right way or running heel. Then is
the time to look for the seal of your otter in the
sand, mud, or other soft places, and note whether
the footprints point up-stream or down. Half the
pleasure of otter-hunting is to see hounds draw,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">« 82 »</a></span>
that is if they draw well, trying every root as they
go, or swimming out to some stone in midstream
on which perhaps there is a piece of wedging.
Here a hound will try a patch of water lilies, there
another will investigate a stick-heap, until at last
there is a welcome note from Thunder, Sailor, or
some other member of the pack, which denotes
that a drag has at last been found. Gradually
they work it out, fast or slow according to its
strength, until at last they mark at a tree-root on
the bank. If you know your hounds you can tell
pretty well whether your otter is there, or has
merely run through the place and gone on. One
or two of your most trusted favourites perhaps
show an inclination to push forward up-stream, so
you go ahead, taking plenty of time at all the likely
holts. Suddenly old Warrior's head goes up, he
winds the air for a second or two, then goes straight
across the river, and his well-known voice rings out
as he proclaims that his otter is this time in the
holt in front of him. The others surge over,
splashing the water as they go, and a wild chorus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">« 83 »</a></span>
awakens the echoes as hounds mark solidly, some
of them tearing at the bank in their eagerness to
have their quarry "out of that." There is no
doubt he is at home, but if there was, you need
only watch old Boatman swimming round and
round beneath the holt in an endeavour to take the
scent or "wash," to convince you that hounds are
right.</p>

<p>The great advantage of meeting early lies in the
fact that if there is an otter or otters working
the water that you propose to hunt, you are
practically sure of finding a drag, which at that
time of day will lie strongly. As already
mentioned, otters lie rough, as well as in holts, and
may be found almost anywhere, often far from the
main river. Here is where you benefit by a warm
trail, for there will be no doubt as to the point at
which your quarry left the main river, and took to
a side-runner, or out across country to some pond
or other favourite feeding ground. Supposing,
however, that your otter has left a drag on the
banks of the main river, which leads hounds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">« 84 »</a></span>
steadily up-stream. If the drag is hot, the pack
will run it at speed, until they finally mark their
otter in his holt, or the trail suddenly comes to an
end, and hounds are at a loss. In this case your
otter may have gone on some distance in the water,
the latter having carried all scent away, and then
landed at some holt farther up. He may, too,
have crossed the stream&mdash;perhaps in deep water&mdash;and
retired to a holt on the opposite bank. Again,
he may have dropped down with the current to his
original starting point, leaving no trace behind
him. If the river is narrow, he may, of course,
have crossed and re-crossed it in his journey
up-stream, the same applying in a lesser degree,
to a wide river. If possible, it is wise therefore to
have a number of hounds on each bank, instead
of, as some huntsmen do, crossing with the pack at
shallows or other spots where the stream can be
forded.</p>

<p>By keeping hounds on the one bank and crossing
here and there, much water and many a likely holt
is passed over. Harking back, however, to where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">« 85 »</a></span>
hounds checked. The otter may still be in front,
therefore it pays to make good the water for some
little distance up-stream. If, within a reasonable
distance, hounds hit off his landing place and mark
him at a holt, well and good, but if there is only
a "touch" here and there on which hounds feather,
denoting a stale line perhaps a day or two old, it
is then advisable to try back. If hounds have
carried the drag at speed, they may, in their
eagerness, have overrun their otter, and left him
not so very far behind. When casting back therefore,
go slowly, and keep some hounds if possible
on both banks. Sooner or later, with anything
like luck, hounds should locate their otter on one
bank or the other. Just as an early start affords
a hot drag, so does it help hounds to more easily
wind their otter in his holt, should he have crossed
and left no trace behind him in the stream. Some
hounds exhibit great aptitude for winding an otter
in this manner, therefore when you see a member
of the pack throw up his head and begin testing
the air, you can be fairly sure that your otter is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">« 86 »</a></span>
far off. If, instead of meeting early you had
arrived at the water late, on the foregoing occasion,
you would probably have hit off a weak or catchy
drag, and have had to go slow, trying both banks
carefully en route. If this happens on a stream
which the Master knows well, and has often hunted
before, he may simply cross and re-cross the water
to the various holts from which he has put down
otters on previous occasions. Should hounds
refuse to mark at any of these holts, and the limit
of the day's draw is reached, the result is a blank.</p>

<p>The same thing may happen on a river which
has not been hunted for a long time. The meet
is late, hounds are left to pick up a drag if they
can, the field following at their leisure, and once
more it is a case of "nothing doing" at the
conclusion of the draw. It is when an otter has
left the main river via a side-stream, or travelled
a long way overland to some pond, or other
retreat, that the advantage of meeting early is so
conspicuous.</p>

<p>Late in the day the drag is very weak and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">« 87 »</a></span>
catchy in the open, where the sun has dried up all
moisture, and even if hounds <i>do</i> show an inclination
to turn up a runner or deviate at some point, they
may not be able to carry the line far, even if
encouraged to do so. If an early start is made,
however, the drag is warm, and hounds can hit
off the place with certainty where their otter has
left the river, and what is more, they can run the
line at speed, thus drawing up to their quarry's
holt, or the spot where he is lying rough, without
loss of time. The chief object of keeping a pack of
otterhounds is to find, hunt, and if possible kill
your otter in a sportsmanlike manner.</p>

<p>Before you can hunt him you must find him, and
on nine days out of ten, this is the hardest part of
the business. An otter may be anywhere, and of
course it may so happen that the water within your
day's draw is not being worked by otters. In this
case you cannot find what is not there. A blank
day then is not only excusable, but inevitable. On
the other hand, if your pack is made up of entered
hounds, and you know their individual idiosyncrasies,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">« 88 »</a></span>
and have in addition a fair knowledge of
the habits of your quarry, there should be little
excuse for a blank day, provided you start early
enough in the morning to afford your hounds the
chance of picking up and sticking to a decent
drag. The <i>surest</i> way of finding an otter is to drag
up to him, any other method, at any rate on rivers,
holds an enormous element of chance. On a lake
or a tarn, which you yourself <i>know</i> is inhabited by
otters, it is a different matter, for you can then
throw off in the reed-beds or other undergrowth
bordering the water, with a good hope of putting
your otter down before hounds have been long
at work.</p>

<p>No fixed rules are applicable to otter-hunting, or
any other kind of hunting for that matter, but it
is safe to say that the Master who is a trier, and
keeps on trying, will be the one to bring to hand
most otters. Being himself of the "never say die"
order, he will inculcate the same spirit in his
hounds, for a slack huntsman makes a slack pack,
and vice versa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">« 89 »</a></span></p>

<p>The late Rev. Jack Russell, of Devonshire fame,
walked some hundreds of miles before he found
his first otter. This was owing to the fact that his
hounds at the beginning were unentered to otter.
When he finally got hold of an entered hound,
matters took a different turn, and he showed capital
sport, but his ill-success at first was certainly not
for want of trying.</p>

<p>When hunting a river, particularly in a hilly
district, a sudden flood may put a stop to sport.
When the weather is unsettled it is wise, therefore,
to allow for such a contingency, and be prepared
to arrange matters so that a smaller stream or lake
can be substituted.</p>

<p>A frequent reason for blank days lies in having
too wide a district to hunt. This means that
certain streams are visited but once a season, and
a single day on each is not sufficient to insure sport.
A certain river is perhaps visited to-day, and
hounds hit off a drag and carry it up-stream a long
way, until the hour is late, and their otter still
unfound. The next fixture is probably in another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">« 90 »</a></span>
county, whereas if hounds were put to water on the
following morning at the place where they left off,
a hunt would be practically a certainty. Again,
if a brace of otters are put down, and one of them
is hunted and eventually killed, a visit to the same
water on the following day would result in the
survivor providing some pretty work for hounds.
There is hardly an Otter Hunt in the kingdom but
what attempts to cover more water in a season
than it can properly manage. The chances of
continuous good sport are on this account
exceedingly doubtful, for unless rivers are
frequently visited, and a fair percentage of otters
are killed, riparian owners, keepers, and others will
refuse to protect otters, and instead, go in for the
killing business themselves. Hunting is in this
country dependent upon the goodwill of landowners
and tenants, who are as a rule only too
pleased to welcome hounds. If, however, the
Hunt does not properly reduce the stock of foxes
or otters, other methods are then resorted to. The
more otters or foxes you kill in your district, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">« 91 »</a></span>
more you will have, for directly people realise that
you and your hounds mean business and are "out
for blood," they will leave it to you to do the killing,
and confine their attentions to preserving your
quarry. A small district, regularly hunted, will
provide much better sport than a large one casually
attended to. The fixture card of the average Otter
Hunt should show "Where leave off" much
oftener than it does at present. In a small district
a Hunt is much less dependent on trains for moving
hounds from place to place, and there is far
more opportunity to "lie out" overnight at some
farm or other homestead, and thus continue
hunting at the same place on the following day.</p>

<p>Harking back to the river, a great many people
imagine that when hounds hit off a line away from
the water, and go full cry through a wood, across
open country, or up some tiny streamlet, that they
are running riot. That hounds occasionally run
riot, more especially the young entry, we do not
for a moment deny, but when a pack of entered
hounds performs in the above manner, they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">« 92 »</a></span>
not rioting, but running the line of a travelling
otter. The huntsman then, instead of blowing
his horn while the whippers-in rate and attempt to
stop hounds, should put his best leg foremost and
try to keep in touch, so that if hounds check, after
covering perhaps a mile or two, he will be there
or thereabouts and have a good idea what to do.</p>

<p>We have vivid recollections of a day on which
hounds hit off the line of an otter that had stolen
away from a rock-holt without being seen or tallied.
She, for it was a young bitch otter, left the main
stream with a good start, and turned up a runner
which lay in a deep, narrow valley. At the head
of this valley the otter turned left-handed and
crossed over more than a mile of open country
comprising the watershed. Descending the other
side, she entered a stream via a hanging covert on
the near bank. When hounds hit off her line,
they raced up the valley with evidently a screaming
scent. At the top they hovered for an instant,
then swept on left-handed over the hill. The
huntsman, who was convinced that they were running
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">« 93 »</a></span>
riot, attempted to stop them, and succeeded
in getting hold of some of them, but the others
went on, and we could hear them speaking merrily
in the direction of the stream in the valley below.
We passed the huntsman, blowing his horn, with
a couple or two of hounds round him, and on asking
him what was the matter, he said hounds were
rioting. Seeing we did not believe him, he
reluctantly followed on, and to cut a long story
short, hounds eventually killed their otter handsomely,
after dusting her up and down the stream
for some three-quarters of an hour. We can see
the expression on that huntsman's face yet, when
hounds collared their otter, and he was obliged to
acknowledge he had been in the wrong, while his
hounds had been right.</p>

<p>Now the first lesson a huntsman, professional
or amateur, has to learn is to <i>trust his hounds</i>. If
he can't do this, he had better leave hunting alone,
and look for another job. Once your hounds
are properly entered, and you know their
individual traits and idiosyncrasies, always trust
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">« 94 »</a></span>
to what <i>they</i> say about it, and pay no attention to
the utterances of a sceptical field, many of whom
know little or nothing about the science of hunting.
The line hounds are running may perhaps seem
a very unusual one, even to you, but if Rouser,
Thunder, Marksman, and a few more of your
trusted favourites are voicing the fact that an otter
is in front of them, then you can bet your life it
is so, and your job is to keep in touch with them
if possible. Always remember that an otter may
be found anywhere, and may do anything once he
is afoot or afloat. The only certain thing about
him is his variability. You will learn something
new about him every day you go out with hounds,
and if you store up the information thus obtained,
it will come in mighty useful on many a future
occasion.</p>

<p>The Master who hunts his own hounds
should study the habits of otters in winter as well
as in summer. After a prolonged snow-fall a visit
to one or other of his rivers, lakes, etc., will afford a
variety of useful information regarding the whereabouts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">« 95 »</a></span>
and the doings of otters. Their tracks will
be plain enough in the snow, and by following
these footprints a knowledge of the various routes
traversed by otters will be gained, and many a long
forgotten drain or other hiding-place discovered.
The lessons thus learnt will come in mighty useful
when the hunting season again begins. When
thus scouting his country, he should not forget to
drop in at the mill, or the various farmsteads near
the river. The miller can be a good friend, or,
if he likes, a bad enemy, and the same applies to
farm-hands, and other people who work on the
land. A chat with the farmer and his wife goes
a long way towards smoothing the ground for
hunting, and a friendly word and a pipe of baccy
with the river-watchers and labourers ensures
amicable relations, and paves the way towards
encouraging an interest in hounds and hunting.</p>

<p>It is the Master who is thus on the job in winter
as well as summer who gets plenty of good walks
for his puppies, and is free to hunt when and where
he likes during the season. On his journeys he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">« 96 »</a></span>
will hear much about otters and their doings, a
great deal of which information, however, he will
take with the proverbial pinch of salt. Half the
people you meet, even those who live near rivers,
have never seen an otter, although there are, of
course, certain individuals whose information is to
be depended on. These are few and far between,
however, and the wise Master will trust to his own
powers of observation, rather than to reports of
hypothetical otters, which in the end turn out to
have been black cats, or some other animals seen
near the water at dusk.</p>

<p>Harking back to our hunting, however, hounds
have marked their otter in his holt in a root or some
other retreat, and the next job is to evict him.
Hounds are called off and taken back out of sight
in a nearby field, and the terriers come on the
scene. Vic or Vengeance is sent in, and very
soon there are sounds underground betokening
"something doing." The barking ceases for a
moment, and then a dark brown object glides out
through the tangled roots, there is a slight splash,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">« 97 »</a></span>
and a long chain of bubbles as the otter takes to
the river. A shrill tally-ho! brings hounds pell-mell
to the scene of action, and the hunt is on.
It all sounds very easy, and sometimes is so, but
on other occasions the otter refuses to bolt, or the
terriers cannot bring sufficient pressure to bear, so
there is nothing for it but send to the nearest farmhouse
for tools. Spades, pick, and crowbar are
soon on the spot, and there may then ensue some
strenuous digging, before the terriers are located,
and finally the otter. Occasionally, when the
terriers are sent in, a rabbit or rabbits may bolt, or
even as has happened before now, a fox. Then
is the time you are likely to hear subdued remarks
from sceptical members of your field. Take no
notice of that. Your hounds say their otter is
there, believe them, no matter how many rabbits
appear. Otters lie very close at times, often till
you dig right up to them, and on such an occasion
you will have the laugh on the "doubting
Thomases," when you pull little terrier Vengeance
out by the stern, and your otter takes to the river.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">« 98 »</a></span>
If a terrier can get behind his otter, he will generally
persuade the quarry to bolt, but if the otter
backs up into a cul-de-sac, the dog is obliged to
face him in front, and if the terrier is a real
"sticker" he will hold his otter there until the
diggers work down to the spot.</p>

<p>Otters will lie up in rabbit burrows, drains, tree-roots,
and sometimes in fox or badger earths.
Rock-holts are also favourite places on the north
country rivers. Where there are several side-drains
branching off a main drain, it is often difficult for the
terriers to locate their otter. Some rock-holts, too,
are practically impregnable, and the same applies to
many a big head of earths in covert. Occasionally
an otter may be persuaded to bolt when other
means have failed, by getting a number of people
to jump on top of the holt, the party doing so in
unison. When digging or terrier operations are
going on, someone should be stationed where they
can keep watch for the otter bolting. If the
quarry can slip out under water, he may get away
undetected, unless a bright look out is kept.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">« 99 »</a></span>
During the time that digging is going on, the field
should be made to stand well back from the scene
of operations. When they crowd round the place,
as the average field so often does, they are a
nuisance to the diggers, and talk so much that it is
often impossible to hear the terriers underground.
Again, should an otter bolt from a drain, and have
some distance to go before reaching the water, the
field are nearly sure to start halloing, with the
result that hounds break away and arrive on the
scene ere the otter has had fair law.</p>

<p>Once the otter is afloat, the next thing is to
keep him going until hounds tire him out, and
at last gain their reward. The field should now
spread out at intervals, along the bank, and <i>stand
still</i>. By doing so each individual can watch the
water in front of him, and tally when he is certain
he sees the otter. When the field persists in
rushing up and down the banks they are a nuisance
to both hounds and huntsman. Standing still,
and keeping a bright look out, they can be of the
greatest service, and at the same time they see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">« 100 »</a></span>
more sport than when constantly shifting their
positions. After he has been hunted for some
time, the otter will begin to show himself, and it is
then perfectly legitimate for the watcher to tally-ho
if he sees the otter. Unless, however, he is sure
that it is the otter, he had best keep silent. A
salmon in rapid water, or a moorhen crossing a
pool, has often deceived a watcher on the bank,
therefore make sure before tallying. Also, never
tally because someone else says he has seen the
otter, see it yourself first. It may be necessary
to send some of the field to form a "stickle" across
the shallows, above or below the scene of action.
These people must keep a sharp look out, watching
the water carefully. If they do their work
properly, the otter should not get past them
without being seen. If the hunt gradually works
up-stream, the people on the lower stickle should
not be forgotten. Some signal, say a few notes
on the whistle, should be given in order to let them
know that they are at liberty to leave their posts.</p>

<p>In rapid, or deep water, an otter will often pass
an experienced hunter without being tallied,
particularly if it is moving close to the farther
bank. The angle at which the light falls on the
water often makes it extremely difficult to detect
an otter as it passes. After being hunted for some
length of time, the otter shows himself more and
more frequently. He may vary the water work
by making an excursion overland, or running the
length of a nearby wood. Perhaps he takes
refuge in a holt, and is then bolted by the terriers.
Anyway, if things go right, the time comes when
he can do no more, and he dies fighting on the
shallows, leaving his mark on nearly every hound.
The huntsman at last gets the pack to leave him,
not using a whip, but pushing hounds off with
knees, hands, and pole, after which he slips the
carcass under water for a minute or two until he
recovers his wind, and then carries it ashore.
There it is weighed, mask, pole, and pads are
severed, the carcass is slit up, and tossed to the
eagerly expectant pack. "Hi, worry, worry,
worry," "Who-whoop! tear him and eat him."
After blowing the "rattle," and cheering hounds
to keep up the excitement, the various trophies are
distributed, and one's thoughts then turn in the
direction of certain bottles which are snugly
reposing in a friend's car on the nearest highway.</p>

<p>Early, or late in the season, when the weather
is boisterous and the water cold, it pays to hold up
a few couples of hounds, reserving them until the
working pack has had about enough of it. Then
at the right moment, throw in your reserves and
make a quick finish. This plan is especially
applicable to lake hunting, when hounds are
continually swimming in deep water.</p>

<p>When hounds are on a drag, or have put down
their otter, the huntsman should encourage them,
cheering them on to any particular hound which
has made a hit, and the same when they mark
solidly at a root. There is no need to be noisy,
but hounds work all the better for encouragement,
and a bit of excitement at a holt teaches young
hounds to mark their otter. To make a success
of otter-hunting, or any other kind of hunting for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">« 104 »</a></span>
that matter, a man must use his brains, and to
some extent call on his powers of imagination.</p>

<p>A chapter on hunting is hardly complete without
some mention of that elusive mystery called scent,
so a few words will be devoted to it here. You
get good and bad scenting days in otter-hunting
just as you do when hunting fox or hare, but the
chase of the otter has the advantage of being
conducted both on land and water, and if scent is
bad on the latter, it may be quite the reverse if
your otter takes to terra firma. Sometimes it is
good on both, though it may happen that an otter
which has been hustled about the woods or across
country apparently gives off little scent when he
returns to the water. A bitch otter in cub, or one
with a young family, appears to often give off little
or no scent, and where hunting takes place
on a river polluted by oil, or other foreign
matter, scent is generally conspicuous by
its absence. Scent varies too at different times
of day. In the early morning, before the sun has
dispelled the dew, it is generally good, but dies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">« 105 »</a></span>
away as the atmosphere becomes warmer. When
the sun begins to sink and the air becomes damp
again, scent is likely to freshen; while a shower
of rain may affect it in the same way. The
vagaries of scent are impossible to foretell with
anything like certainty, and perhaps it is as well so,
otherwise sport would become too cut and dried,
and would lose much of its interest on that account.</p>

<p>Occasionally an otter takes refuge behind
weiring or in some other retreat, that necessitates
pulling down a certain amount of the obstruction
before he can be evicted. In this case, permission
from the owner or tenant of the place should be
obtained before beginning operations. In the
same way, should the owner or tenant object to
the presence of hounds on his land, always be civil,
no matter what he says, and take hounds away without
any argument. The life of the sport depends
upon the existence of amicable relations between
the Hunt and the owners of the land which they
cross. Although terriers can as a rule bolt an
otter if they can get to him, ferrets have been used
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">« 106 »</a></span>
for the same purpose before to-day. Both otters
and foxes have on occasion been bolted from rabbit
burrows during ferreting operations. In some
countries artificial drains or holts have been
constructed for the use of otters, but there is usually
a good deal of uncertainty as to whether the otters
will take to such abodes. Where old drains run
a long way into the land, with possibly a number
of branch drains, it is often wise to place iron
gratings at some distance from the mouth, in order
to facilitate matters when it comes to bolting an
otter. As the great charm about otter-hunting is
its freedom from artificiality, <i>made</i> holts or drains
need hardly be encouraged, except perhaps in
extreme cases where there is no suitable lying-up
place for otters over a long stretch of water.</p>

<p>When hunting hounds, the Master will be
assisted in the field by two whippers-in, which may
consist of the paid kennelman, and an amateur.
Their job is to keep hounds in check when
necessary, prevent rioting, if any, and keep in
touch with the pack should hounds go off across
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">« 107 »</a></span>
country with a screaming scent. Taking it for
granted that the paid hand knows his job, the
amateur should be equally proficient. He must
keep a keen look out as he goes for signs of otters,
as well as hidden drains, etc., and he must know the
names of all the hounds and their individual
idiosyncrasies, so as to tell instantly if they are
inclined to riot, or they show an inclination to mark
at roots, or take a line away from the river.
Speaking broadly, the whippers-in prevent hounds
going too fast and outpacing the Master and the
field, but it should be remembered that hounds can
be kept <i>too much</i> in check, and by so doing they
are balked in their desire to hunt, as well as drive
on when scenting conditions are good. In fox or
hare hunting, the huntsman's place is with his
hounds, whether they are drawing or running, and
there appears to be no good reason why an otter-huntsman
should not "get a move on" when his
hounds push ahead on a hot drag, or drive along
across country. It is quite as necessary to run, and
often run hard, with otterhounds, as to ride hard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">« 108 »</a></span>
with foxhounds, and the huntsman who takes his
own time whilst his whipper-in is bursting himself
across country is surely lacking in keenness.</p>

<p>Although otter-hunting does not call for as much
quickness on the part of the huntsman as fox-hunting,
we still must confess we like to see a
huntsman of otterhounds show some agility when
his hounds run fast. This particularly applies to
hunting in the north, where otters so often cross
steep watersheds. A great deal of valuable time
is frequently lost, simply because the huntsman
prefers to take his own time, instead of attempting
to keep in close touch with hounds, and thus be
on the spot should they momentarily require his
assistance. As far as the field are concerned, it is
their own fault if they are left behind when hounds
run. When travelling with hounds on the highway,
however, the huntsman and whippers-in should go
at a reasonable pace, so as to give the field a chance&mdash;particularly
the ladies&mdash;to be there when hounds
are put to water. Racing ahead with hounds on
the roads gets the pack into the habit of pushing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">« 109 »</a></span>
on when there is really no need for it, so a
reasonable walking pace should be aimed at.</p>

<p>When hounds have put their otter down, or "hit
him abroad," to use an old expression, and are
swimming him, the huntsman should keep on the
shallow side of the river, more particularly if the
farther bank is thickly overgrown with willows or
other cover. From the shallow side he has a clear
view of what his hounds are doing, and if it is
necessary to pole the farther bank if an otter
persists in hanging there, he should ask one of
his whippers-in, or some experienced member of
the field to do it for him.</p>

<p>With regard to clothing and etceteras for
otter-hunting, little need be said here. Hunt
uniforms are usually made of woollen serge
material, which dries quickly, and withstands a lot
of rough usage. Shorts are sometimes worn, but
in our experience loose knickerbockers are much
preferable, particularly for hunt officials who may
have to force their way through briers or other
undergrowth in the execution of their duty. Bare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">« 110 »</a></span>
knees and thorns do not associate well together,
while breeches of the semi-riding type are too
tight-fitting, and retain water. Boots or shoes
should be well nailed to prevent slipping,
preferably with soft, wrought-iron hobs, which get
a better grip on rocks than steel nails. An iron-shod
pole of ash or hazel&mdash;the latter is light yet
strong&mdash;is necessary for crossing deep or swift
water, and in some districts as an aid to jumping
wide ditches and open drains. A pole shod with
a double-pronged spike is less liable to slip than
one armed with a single spike. Likewise a pole
cut from the growing tree or sapling looks more
workmanlike than a "made" one, ornamented with
a fancy metal head or other embellishment. With
regard to the whip, for use by Hunt officials, one
with a short lash is to be preferred, for it can be
far more easily cracked when the user is standing
in water than a long-lashed affair.</p>

<p>The huntsman who cannot blow an ordinary
horn without unnecessary discords will be well
advised to secure a reed-horn. Every call can be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">« 111 »</a></span>
sounded on this, with the exception of that "to
call hounds away," and for this quite a good
substitute can be blown. When using the horn,
he should employ distinct calls, then both hounds
and field know what he means. Some huntsmen
blow the same note all day long, and hounds take
no heed of it, while the monotonous sound gets on
the nerves of the field.</p>

<p>Nowadays the otter-hunting season extends from
April to September, but in the fourteenth century
it lasted from February to June.</p>

<span class="smaller">HOUNDS AND TERRIERS</span></p>


<p>The average otterhound pack to-day is usually
composed of foxhounds, cross-bred hounds, and a
few couples of pure, rough-coated otterhounds.
In the old days the latter predominated in most
packs, and it is only of late years that the foxhound
has come to the fore in the pursuit of <i>Lutra</i>.</p>

<p>The origin of the rough-coated hound is more
or less shrouded in mystery, but it is pretty safe to
say that he is closely related to the bloodhound.
If true to type he possesses many of the bloodhound's
characteristics, including the long pendulous
ears, the deep-set eye showing the haw, and
the black and tan colour which so often predominates.
The rough coat was gained by a cross of
some sort, but it is impossible to say with certainty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">« 113 »</a></span>
what this cross was. The wire-haired Welsh
harrier may have had something to do with it, and
again it is quite likely that the old hard-coated
Lancashire harrier may have been used for the
same purpose. It is possible, too, that the old
southern hound was crossed with the bloodhound,
while there are those who believe that the French
griffon had a share in the business. Thus we see
that the rough outer coat may have come from a
variety of sources, but the thick, woolly under-coat
is no doubt a provision of nature to protect the
hound from the effects of frequent and long-continued
immersion in the water. This under
coat is worn by the Chesapeake Bay dog, a breed
of retriever much used by wildfowl shooters in
America.</p>

<p>In the fourteenth century raches or running
hounds&mdash;known later simply as hounds&mdash;were of
various kinds. In the "Master of Game" it says:
"There be also many kinds of running hounds,
some small and some big, and the small be called
kenets, and these hounds run well to all manner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">« 114 »</a></span>
of game, and they (that) serve for all game men
call them harriers. And every hound that hath
that courage will come to be a harrier by nature
with little making."</p>

<p>Harrier was in those days spelt heyrer, and it
was not until after the sixteenth century that the
modern spelling came into vogue. It was probably
derived from the Anglo-Saxon <i>herian</i>, to
harry or disturb. In the "Boke of St Albans"
it says that the hart, the buck, and the boar should
be started by a limer, and that all "other bestes
that huntyd shall be sought for and found by
Ratches so free." Thus it appears that all beasts
that were enchased were moved by a lime-hound,
while those that were hunted up were found by
raches. The otter-hunting illustration in the
"Master of Game" shows five hounds, one of
which is on leash, and appears to be a limer. The
otter was certainly not enchased in those days,
being looked upon as vermin, yet as the picture
shows a limer at work, it is possible that lime-hounds
were sometimes used for other game than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">« 115 »</a></span>
the recognised beasts of chase. The hound shown
swimming the otter is bloodhound-like, while two
smaller hounds appear to have broken coats. In
the fourteenth century the otter and various other
creatures, such as the rabbit, fox, wild cat, etc.,
were hunted by <i>biss hunters</i> (fur hunters) for
their skins, and no doubt the smaller breed of
hounds then known as heyrers were employed in
their capture.</p>

<p>Coming down to modern times, there are, as far
as we are aware, but two existing otterhound packs
entirely composed of pure, rough-coated otterhounds.
All other establishments employ mixed
packs. Cross-bred hounds are usually the result
of a union between a pure otterhound bitch and a
foxhound. The majority of foxhounds which find
their way to the otterhound kennels have been
drafted for over-height, age, or faults. They are
often presented to the M.O.H., or he buys them at
a low figure. Having purchased or otherwise got
together sufficient hounds to make a start, you can
gradually weed them out, retaining the best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">« 116 »</a></span>
workers for future breeding operations. It is
perhaps unnecessary to state that you must have
a couple or two of entered hounds to begin with,
otherwise you are likely to walk as far as the Rev.
Jack Russell did before you find an otter. As
regards cross-bred hounds, the first cross may be
capital workers, but it is doubtful if much good
comes from breeding from them.</p>

<p>One sees all shapes, makes, and sizes of rough
hounds in the various packs, but the best bred ones
are big, upstanding animals, from twenty-two to
twenty-four or more inches in height. Speaking
from our own experience, we have found the
majority of rough hounds to be much more clumsy
and less active than foxhounds. Their feet, too,
are often inclined to be open and flat, and they lack
the heart and stamina of the foxhound. There
are, of course, exceptions, and we have come
across rough hounds that were capital workers,
but take them all round they are too big and
clumsy, at any rate for work on rough, rocky
streams. Despite their rough jackets, they suffer
from the effects of long immersion in water far
more than the foxhound, whose short, smooth coat
is dry after a shake or two. In addition they are
not such good doers as the foxhound, and require
more attention after hunting. They are also apt
to be quarrelsome in kennel. Many of them
possess extremely fine noses, and can speak to a
line a day or two old, but this is of no practical
help in hunting, because it is impossible to drag
up to an otter that has been so long gone. They
swim well, and often draw well when swimming,
but the foxhound is quite their equal in this
respect. In our experience the hound that can
wind his otter across the stream and go straight
to him is more often a foxhound than a rough
hound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">« 117 »</a></span></p>

<p>The foxhound, too, is usually a better marker
once he has entered properly, and when it comes to
holding and killing an otter, the rough hound
cannot compare with him. Across country, too,
and when an otter runs through covert, the foxhound's
dash and drive at once put him in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">« 118 »</a></span>
lead. The rough hound has a resonant, musical
voice, and a picturesque appearance, but taking
him all round, from a solely <i>working</i> point of view,
he is, in our humble opinion, inferior to the foxhound,
particularly on rough, rocky rivers, where a
light-built, active type of hound shows to advantage.
Custom ordains that hounds for otter-hunting
should be rough jacketed, and by employing
cross-bred or rough Welsh foxhounds you get
the rough coat, without the undesirable qualities
found in the pure otterhounds.</p>

<p>The latter show to the best advantage in low-lying
country, where the rivers are slow running,
and the going easy. In these days, when meets
are late and time is valuable, pure otterhounds with
their tender noses dwell and revel on the drag
instead of pushing forward. The foxhound, on the
other hand, may feather on a stale line, but he will
not as a rule open unless the drag is fairly fresh.
When he does throw his tongue, you can confidently
cheer the others to him, knowing that
your otter is not so very far in front. Although
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">« 119 »</a></span>
we cannot deny that the deep, resonant music of
a pack of pure otterhounds is delightful to listen
to, something more than the "band" is required
to kill an otter.</p>

<p>Foxhounds, cross-breds, and Welsh hounds
throw their tongues well enough, and in addition
they possess dash and drive, with little or no
inclination to dwell. Foxhounds, before they
have entered properly, draw wide and will not
always stick to the river, but if they have done a
few season's stag-hunting&mdash;thus being used to
water work&mdash;they generally enter well to otter and
draw closely enough. A hound may not take any
interest in the sport during his first season, but the
following season he may prove to be one of the
best. Unfortunately the majority of draft foxhounds
are aged before they find their way to the
otterhound kennels, therefore any lengthy delay
in entering to their new quarry shortens the period
of their usefulness, that at the best cannot be very
long.</p>

<p>Aged foxhounds after a time show an inclination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">« 120 »</a></span>
to dwell and revel in the scent, and when
this happens it is a sign that their utility is
coming to an end. If possible always get hold
of foxhounds which throw their tongues freely,
and have nothing whatever to do with a mute
hound. However closely you keep an eye on
the latter, he will sooner or later get away "on
his own," and be the means of spoiling more
than one good hunt. No matter how good a mute
hound is in his work, get rid of him, for unless
he lets you know what he is doing he is useless to
you. Likewise, never on any consideration be
tempted to breed from a mute hound. Rough
otterhounds cannot stand punishment like the
foxhound, and will howl and kick up a dreadful
racket if hurt, or hit with the whip for some fault.</p>

<p>It is during the course of a long hunt in heavy
or chilly water that the average rough otterhound
will pull out and sit shivering on the bank, while
the foxhounds are keeping their otter on the move.
In our experience, the foxhound is a much better
fresh-finder than the pure otterhound, and it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">« 121 »</a></span>
the hounds good at fresh-finding and keeping
their otter going that do most towards bringing
the quarry to hand. At the end of a long day, too,
the cross-breds and foxhounds will return to
kennels with their sterns up, while many of the
rough sort exhibit a very depressed appearance.
They never seem to pick their feet up like a
foxhound, but shuffle about in an ungainly
fashion. When it comes to killing an otter, the
foxhound has it all his own way. Time and
again we have seen him seize and hold a big otter,
often shaking his quarry like a fox. The rough
hound often fails in this respect, for he has not
the courage to make him a good seizer and killer.
A foxhound which comes to the otterhound
kennels with the reputation of being a good
marker nearly always keeps up his fame in the
same way when entered to otter. Good marking
hounds are the mainstay of any pack. As far
as brains are concerned, the foxhound appears to
make more use of his "grey matter" than the
rough hound, and shows more initiative and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">« 122 »</a></span>
individuality. His pace and activity, too, are
beyond question, both of which qualities are of
the greatest assistance when swimming an otter,
and more particularly when hunting one across
country or through extensive coverts. It is the
active hounds which score so often on rough and
rocky rivers, for drive and pace are an occasion
quite as necessary in otter-hunting as fox-hunting.</p>

<p>The cross between foxhound and rough otterhound
possesses many of the attributes of the
former, including a rough jacket, and thus is
admirably fitted for the pursuit of <i>Lutra</i>.</p>

<p>Turning to Welsh hounds, some of which have
rough, and others smooth coats, we find a breed
admirably suited to both fox and otter-hunting.
Many Welsh hounds are white or nearly so, while
others are the old black-and-tan colour. The
English foxhound of standard type is bigger
and has more substance than the Welsh hound,
but the latter excels in nose and tongue, and can
stand any amount of hard work in rough country.
In our experience, too, Welsh hounds&mdash;particularly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">« 123 »</a></span>
those of the smaller type&mdash;are very active,
and have plenty of drive, while they are often
capital markers, and can hold and kill an otter
quite as quickly as any English foxhound.</p>

<p>Another type of hound admirably suited to
otter-hunting is the fell-foxhound of Cumberland
and Westmorland. He is for the most
part a light-built, active sort, with a capital nose,
and any amount of tongue. In the Lakes and
certain districts adjoining, fell-hounds often hunt
fox in winter and otter in summer. The fell-hounds
are kennelled in the fox-hunting season,
but go out to walk in summer, and generally a
few couples are lent to the local otterhounds for
the chase of <i>Lutra</i>. In our experience fell-hounds
enter quickly to otter, and on our rough
and rocky northern rivers they are very hard to
beat as all round performers. Many of them
are capital markers, and they will hunt a drag,
and kill an otter with the best.</p>

<p>Turning to the "Otter-hunting Diary" of the
late Mr James Lomax, of Clayton Hall, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">« 124 »</a></span>
kept a pack from 1829 to 1871, we find an
illustration of the old Lancashire harrier or
foumart-hound. The picture shows a couple of
rough-haired hounds in full cry, which appear a
medium-sized, light-built, active type; more
suggestive of the rough Welsh foxhound than
the modern otterhound. Mr Lomax used these
foumart-hounds in crossing with his otterhounds.
In another illustration, showing some of the pack
in 1835, the type of hound appears to be lighter-built
and more active-looking than the big,
present-day rough otterhound.</p>

<p>The tendency with English foxhounds has
been to breed them much bigger than was the
case in former years, and the same apparently
applies to the rough otterhound. Certainly a tall
hound can wade where a smaller hound is obliged
to swim, but a medium-sized, active type is less
clumsy, and more fitted for work on rocky streams
than the heavy hounds now seen in most packs.
From a purely working point of view, a pack
composed of English, Welsh, and fell-foxhounds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">« 125 »</a></span>
would be very hard to beat. By judicious
crossing, an ideal pack could be bred, retaining
to a great extent the rough coat of the Welsh
hound, if that was thought indispensable to the
appearance of the pack.</p>

<p>Although draft foxhounds are generally used
for otter-hunting, it pays to get hold of a bitch or
two and breed from them. By so doing you can
gradually get together a pack composed of hounds
of the desired sort, and if you are lucky you may
be able to hunt fox with them in the winter, and
thus keep hounds in condition for their summer
work. Hounds, like human beings, get very fed-up
with continual road exercise, therefore a bit
of winter hunting appeals to them far more than
the dull routine of exercise walks.</p>

<p>Next in importance to the hounds are the
terriers, for without their help it would be
impossible to eject an otter from his holt. The
most important quality in a terrier is gameness,
for no matter how well built he is, if he has not
the courage to go below ground and stay with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">« 126 »</a></span>
his otter until the latter bolts, or the diggers
unearth him, he is not worth his keep. Provided
he is thoroughly game, and not too big, it matters
not how a terrier is bred. He is there to work,
and not to be looked at. Roughly speaking, a
terrier of about 14 lb. weight will be suited to
otter-hunting. As, apart from bolting otters, he
will not be called upon to do any great amount
of travelling over rough country, short legs are
no great drawback to him. For all that, however,
we like to see a terrier with a fair length of leg,
for there are certain holts, particularly amongst
rocks, where an otter can command the upper
position, and a short-legged terrier is much
handicapped when trying to get at him. A
terrier should have a fair head and jaw, and he
should be as narrow in front as is compatible with
adequate heart and lung room. A narrow-fronted
dog can always get into a smaller place
than a broad-chested one, even if he is longer
on the leg. A terrier that will lie up close to an
otter and move him with his tongue is preferable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">« 127 »</a></span>
to one that goes straight in to the attack. His
barking eventually gets on the otter's nerves
and causes him to get "out of that," while
should the otter refuse to bolt, the terrier's voice
is a guide as to where to dig. A terrier soon
learns his job, and after getting mauled a time
or two by otters, he will make more use of his
tongue than his teeth. When entering a puppy
for the first time, choose an easy place, so that
the youngster has a fair chance to get in touch
with his otter.</p>

<p>As to the colour of a terrier, good ones&mdash;like
horses&mdash;come in all colours. White is perhaps
preferable, as a white terrier is less likely to be
mistaken for the otter by hounds at a kill.
Certainly white terriers appear to suffer fewer
casualties in this respect than coloured ones. As
to whether terriers should run loose with hounds
is a question the Master must settle for himself.
When terriers are loose, there is always the
chance that cubs may be chopped by them,
though to set against such a contretemps, many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">« 128 »</a></span>
an otter is found and put down by the terriers.
Again, coloured terriers running loose may be
killed or badly mauled by hounds, when the latter
are hard at their otter.</p>

<p>During the season of 1921, with the K. and
D.O.H., we had two coloured terriers worried by
hounds, one of which recovered but the other
died the same night. The otter, which was
getting beat, took to land, and hounds collared
him as he left the water, the terriers being seized
by some of the pack in mistake for their quarry.
Had those terriers been in the couples at the
time, they would have been saved. It is really
safest to lead the terriers until they are wanted,
and after bolting their otter they should be got
hold of again as soon as possible. The same
when hounds are worrying their otter, always pick
up the terriers if any of them are loose.</p>

<p>In order that hounds shall keep fit and well,
they must receive proper attention in the kennel.
Less flesh is needed for feeding otterhounds
than foxhounds, because they do their work in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">« 129 »</a></span>
summer, and both the season of the year and the
work itself do not make so great a call on their
powers as does the chase of the fox in winter.
During the off season, otterhounds should be
exercised for two or three hours daily, and as
the hunting season approaches the exercise can
be gradually lengthened. With a pack of cross-bred,
Welsh, or English foxhounds, it is possible
to hunt otters in summer and fox in winter, and
where this can be done, hounds will, of course,
keep perfectly fit. In the case of the fell-foxhounds,
those hunting otter in summer return to
their own kennels for the winter fox-catching.
As far as food is concerned, this should always
be given thick, rather than soft and sloppy.
Hounds splash "slop" into their eyes, and get
particles of it up their nostrils, to the detriment
of both sight and olfactory powers. On the
return from hunting, cuts and bruises should be
attended to, and thorns, etc., extracted. Hounds'
coats should also be brushed, and burrs, etc.,
removed. Rough hounds require more looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">« 130 »</a></span>
after in this respect than smooth-coated ones.
The huntsman should see that his hounds are
fed and properly bedded down before he attends
to his own wants. If hounds look well and hunt
well, you can rest assured that your huntsman
or feeder is paying proper attention to the pack
in kennel. As regards kennels, these need not
be of an expensive nature, but the drainage and
general sanitation <i>must</i> be adequate if hounds
are to keep fit. Wherever waste matter is
present, either in the boiling house, feeding
place, or yards, there will disease germs gather,
and complaints amongst hounds will be for ever
breaking out. The old adage "Cleanliness is
next to godliness" applies as much to hounds
and their kennels as it does to human beings
and their houses.</p>

<p>Some huntsmen are apt to let hounds get very
much out of condition during the winter months,
instead of exercising regularly, which means that
on the approach of the hunting season all sorts
of physic is used in an attempt to get them fit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">« 131 »</a></span>
again. It is quite safe to say that the less
medicine you employ about the kennels the
better, and there will be little or no need for it
if hounds are rationally fed and exercised in the
winter.</p>

<span class="smaller">REMINISCENCES</span></p>


<p>There are very few Masters in the country who
hunt fox in winter and otter in summer with the
same hounds, and fewer still we imagine who have
killed an otter and a fox on the same day. The
latter feat was performed by the Master of the
South Tetcott, whose hounds found and killed an
otter on the River Othery, after which they
unkennelled a fox cub, and after rattling him about
a bit, eventually brought him to hand.</p>

<p>One of the few packs hunting both fox and otter
is the Ynsfor, a private pack owned by Major
Evan Jones. His country lies in Carnarvon and
Merioneth, Snowdon and the adjoining mountains
lying within its borders. The Master is his own
huntsman, and hounds are followed on foot, owing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">« 133 »</a></span>
to the precipitous nature of the country. The
pack is composed of the old Welsh breed, some
rough and some smooth, with many of the old
black-and-tan colour amongst them. These
hounds have been in Major Jones's family since
1765.</p>

<p>Probably few people have been out with both
foxhounds and otterhounds on the same day, but
we can plead guilty to having accomplished this
feat. Before the L.D.O.H. were disbanded,
hounds met very early one morning, but failed
to get an otter afloat, and when they returned to
kennels we went off and joined the Coniston
Foxhounds, and eventually saw Reynard accounted
for.</p>

<p>A great many people appear to have a rooted
idea that an otter is a slow-moving, clumsy creature,
which never leaves the vicinity of water. Such an
assumption is, to say the least of it, inaccurate, as
anyone can easily testify, particularly those who
have done much otter-hunting on the rocky rivers
of the north. In a previous chapter we have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">« 134 »</a></span>
mentioned a hunt during which the otter crossed a
watershed, and this brings to mind a seven and a
half hours' hunt by the K. and D.O.H. on the
River Lune in the season of 1921. The otter was
lying rough in a hanging wood overlooking the
river, and was found by a little fell-foxhound
named Cragsman, belonging to the Ullswater pack.
After some up and down work on the river, our
otter stole away on land, and crossed some fields
to a small stream which runs between steep banks.
There was a screaming scent, and hounds fairly
flew in pursuit. The otter ran the small stream
nearly to the top of the ghyll, then turned and
came back. In a rock-bound pool he lay low, but
hounds were soon at him again. The pool lay
between smooth and slippery walls of rock, and at
first the otter barely showed his nose. Suddenly,
however, he made a terrific spring&mdash;his hind legs
no doubt getting purchase on a ledge below the
surface of the water&mdash;and all but got clear of the
pool. He hung for a brief instant on the rock
wall, making the picture of a lifetime for anyone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">« 135 »</a></span>
lucky enough to have been there with a camera,
then he turned and fell with a splash into the pool.
It was a miracle how he got clear, but get away
he did to run the fields again, and take refuge in
a rabbit burrow on the bank of the main river.
Hounds were taken away, and after a bit of work
the terriers bolted him. He took down stream,
and after the pack was laid on, a couple of hounds
collared him on the shallows. He appeared to
fling these hounds off as if they were straws, then
he shot into a pool, raising a splash and a wake
like a hydroplane as he crossed it.</p>

<p>Reaching the farther bank, he at once took to
the hanging wood, and went straight up it. He
gained a short start by this man&oelig;uvre, then the
pack was roaring in his wake. Running the wood
like a fox, it looked at first as if he was going right
out at the top, but he turned and came down again,
crossed the river and took refuge in a strong root
holt. Some time was spent digging before he
could be ejected, and when he was at last obliged
to bolt, he again went straight across the river and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">« 136 »</a></span>
took to the wood. Hounds drove him round it,
and he once more took the water. Here he
entered a long but not very deep pool, and hounds
swam him down it, then he turned and hounds
checked. There was little or no cover on the
banks, but he got out without being seen, the first
warning we had of his departure being given by
a young, rough hound which hit off his line in the
wood. This time he ran straight out to the top of
the covert, turned left-handed and crossed the open
fields for more than a mile, just beating hounds
to a drain, the grating of which had been
moved, where he got in and was eventually
left.</p>

<p>We viewed this otter several times at close
quarters, and estimated his weight at nearer 30 lb.
than 25 lb.</p>

<p>He showed extraordinary running powers and
activity for so large an otter, and it was hard luck
on hounds that he beat them.</p>

<p>There was a screaming scent on land, but when
he took the water for the last time, hounds had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">« 137 »</a></span>
some difficulty in owning the wash. That otter
would most certainly have convinced anyone who
was sceptical of <i>Lutra's</i> activity and running
powers.</p>

<p>We have already mentioned the fondness that
otters have&mdash;particularly in Canada&mdash;for sliding.
When engaged in this amusement, they tuck their
forelegs in, and toboggan down the bank on their
stomachs. This season (1921), whilst the Coniston
Foxhounds were hunting on the fells, a couple
and a half of hounds ran a fox in the direction of
an earth on which some of the field were standing.
About the same time, an otter suddenly ran out
from some rocks near the main earth, and after
going some distance, tucked in its head and forelegs,
and actually <i>rolled</i> some yards downhill.
We were on the opposite side of the valley at the
time, but a very keen and experienced fox and otter
hunter who was there, and witnessed the incident,
said that he had never seen anything like it before
in his life.</p>

<p>A name to conjure with in the annals of Lakeland
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">« 138 »</a></span>
otter-hunting is that of the late Bobby
Troughton. He was born on Fellside, Kendal, in
1836. In the early eighties he purchased three
hounds, "Raleigh," "Ragman," and "Londesborough,"
and with these three hounds and a
couple of terriers he began to hunt the local rivers.
Having thus formed the nucleus of a pack, he
gradually added to it and improved it, until the
late Mr Courtenay Tracy, M.O.H., said there
was not another pack like it in England. Bobby's
heaviest otter was a big dog weighing 32 lb., and
was killed in Rydal Lake. One of his most famous
hunts took place in Lever's Water on the Coniston
fells. Hounds met at 5 a.m. at the foot of Yewdale
Beck, and striking a hot drag at once, went out
towards the hills. Near the edge of the tarn they
put their otter down, and he at once took to the
water. For nine hours he kept hounds going, and
it was not until some of the field volunteered to go
to Coniston for a boat&mdash;no small undertaking&mdash;that
Bobby was able to get afloat himself, and give
his hounds a helping hand. At long last the otter
attempted to land, and hounds collared him, thus
earning their reward.</p>

<p>At one time in the north, packs of rough hounds
were kept for hunting otter, marten, and foumart.
One of the last of these packs to hunt in the Lake
District belonged to the late Mr Fleming Green,
of Grasmere. Anthony Chapman, who was his
huntsman, and later hunted the Windermere
Harriers for many seasons, is still hale and hearty,
and delights in a "crack" about old times.</p>

<p>Another well-known Master in the north was the
late Mr James Lomax, of Clayton Hall, Great
Harwood, Lancashire.</p>

<p>His "Otter-hunting Diary" contains an account
of the sport he enjoyed from 1829 to 1871, and is
most interesting reading. Like Bobby Troughton
in later years, he bred a very perfect pack of
hounds of the rough-coated type. In 1871
rabies unfortunately broke out in his kennels,
necessitating the destruction of all but three of the
hounds. Being himself advanced in years, he
made no attempt to start a new pack, despite the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">« 140 »</a></span>
many offers of hounds he received, and one cannot
blame him. By the time he had got together
another pack as good as the one he had lost, he
would as he said himself have been too old to follow
and enjoy the sport. Mr Lomax always met very
early in the morning, often as soon as 3 a.m. He
showed wonderful sport on Ribble, Lune, and
many other rivers, and old men who can remember
hunting with him, speak in glowing terms of the
great hunts they enjoyed with his pack. In one
respect Mr Lomax differed from present-day
Masters, i.e., in the practice of "sacking" otters
and removing them to more huntable waters.
There are in the diary, several instances recorded
of such otters having died, so that the practice
was not a profitable one.</p>

<p>The most famous otter-hunter Scotland has ever
seen was the late Mr Waldron Hill, of Murrayfield
House, near Edinburgh.</p>

<p>When quite a young man he contracted
consumption, and was told by his doctors that he
had not long to live. Nothing daunted, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">« 141 »</a></span>
Mr Hill took to otter-hunting, and the sport agreed
with him so well, that he hunted practically every
river in Scotland, and lived to be far advanced in
years.</p>

<p>When the West Lothian Foxhounds were in
existence, Mr Hill used to run with them, and saw
as much sport as most of the mounted brigade.</p>

<p>In "Field and Fern," <i>The Druid</i> wrote regarding
Mr Hill: "Some years ago he had a pack of
otterhounds in Monmouthshire, of the Welsh
breed, smooth and white with yellow ears; for the
last five years he has had black and tans, a cross
between the bloodhound and rough Lancashire
hound, which is used in that country for otter and
foumart. Their nose is nearly equal to the Lancashire
hound, who are unrivalled in this respect
and never disposed to be tonguey. The bloodhound
cross also makes them more savage in their
worry, but they are often very unpleasant to
manage in kennel. Mr Hill has found the foxhound
fail in working up to his otter in a cold drag,
but excellent on the line when the game is fairly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">« 142 »</a></span>
started. With him the southern hound has only
failed from lack of constitution, which is injured
by too much swimming."</p>

<p>Mr Hill used terriers of Welsh breed, which he
got from the kennels of Mr Ramsay Williams,
after the latter's death. These terriers weighed
about 15 lb., and were bred as flat-sided as
possible to enable them to squeeze into narrow
places. They were fairly long on the leg, and
were used for bolting fox, otter, marten, and
foumart. Mr Hill's principal river was the Tyne,
flowing through Haddingtonshire. Speaking of
the South Esk, <i>The Druid</i> says: "Last August it
was the scene of a very remarkable run, as the
otter only touched the water twice for a few
minutes throughout a run of eight or nine miles,
and was eventually pulled down in the heart of one
of the East Lothian fox-whins." Regarding a
long drag with Mr Hill's hounds, <i>The Druid</i> says:
"In '62 the hounds hit upon one at the Clutby
Dam reservoir on the north side of the Pentlands,
and hunted him through the sheep-drains right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">« 143 »</a></span>
over the Pentlands, down to the reservoir at St
Catherine's. He had gone through it on the north
side, and from there down the Glencorn burn,
nearly to the North Esk. Leaving this for another
burn across the country, he headed back to the
reservoir at St Catherine's, where, on account of
the water being too high, he could not be moved.
This otter must have travelled nearly twenty miles
during the night, and it was well for Mr Hill that
his terriers were long-legged; and that he himself
is always in condition summer or winter, or he
would have seen nothing of the fun on that hot
and very wet September morning." We wonder
how far the members of a modern otter-hunting
field would get, if asked to follow hounds on a hot
drag for twenty miles? Not far we'll warrant, for
most of them would swear that hounds were on a
fox.</p>

<p>People who incautiously "tail" an otter are very
apt to get bitten, and regarding this <i>The Druid</i>
says: "In all these forays Mr Hill has never got
heavily bitten himself; but many years ago, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">« 144 »</a></span>
he was hunting on the Kenvy near Abergavenny,
the otter came out of the water just before it was
killed, made straight at the whip, who was a few
yards off his master, shook him savagely by the
trousers, and then passed on."</p>

<p>We have heard people say that an otter makes no
splash when diving or otherwise entering the
water. Certainly at times he does not make much
of a disturbance, for his sinuous body is built for
swimming, but when playing in the water, or when
hunted, he splashes quite a lot. We were on one
occasion watching the mouth of a drain on the river
Lune, in which the terriers were baiting an otter.
In front of this drain was a row of willow trees.
Standing quietly a yard or so to one side of the
drain entrance we at last saw the otter show himself.
He stood at the drain mouth sniffing the air,
the muscles working his thick "whiskers," giving
his face a very puffed out appearance. Hearing
or seeing some of the field on the opposite bank of
the river he turned round and went back up the
drain. A fairly long interval elapsed, and we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">« 145 »</a></span>
were just bending down to listen at the drain
mouth, when, without the slightest warning the
otter shot out, and leapt straight through the willow
tree, to land in the water with a splash like a sack
of oats. From where he took off, to the point
where he hit the river, constituted a remarkable
jump, and he must have been coming pretty fast
when he shot out of the drain.</p>

<p>On another occasion at the same drain, which is
a favourite resort of otters, the terriers were at
work, and an opening had been made into the drain
at some distance from the river. We were watching
the drain mouth, and after a bit the otter
showed himself, but went back. The bank where
we stood was high, and there was a certain amount
of rubbish in the way of dead branches, etc.,
partially covering the drain mouth. Being below
the bank we could not see what was happening
in the field, and we were greatly astonished when
a big otter suddenly rushed over the edge of the
bank, nearly on top of us, scrambled through the
branches, and disappeared up the drain. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">« 146 »</a></span>
terriers had bolted him in the field, and we, of
course, were unaware of what was happening.
This otter finally emerged at the drain mouth, but
unlike his predecessor, took the water quietly
below the willow trees.</p>

<p>In Walton's description of a morning's sport
with Mr Sadler's "Otter-dogs," Sweetlips&mdash;one of
the hounds&mdash;brings the carcass of the otter to
"Venator." We have on several occasions seen
a hound seize and carry a dead-beat otter ashore.
This is easily done in the case of a 12 lb. or 14 lb.
otter, but it is a different matter for a hound to
handle a big, fighting dog otter. When a hunted
otter is floating on top of the water, he often makes
a considerable splash if he dives in a hurry.</p>

<p>Although perhaps not so good a climber as some
other members of the weasel family, the otter is no
slouch at negotiating steep, rocky ghylls, and can
scramble about in a wonderful manner. It seems
rather hard to account for the fact that in some
seasons hounds kill a majority of dog otters, while
in other seasons the total is chiefly made up of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">« 147 »</a></span>
bitches. Where you find a bitch otter, there is
often a dog within a mile or so, either up or down
stream; and no doubt the two of them keep that
particular stretch of water free from other lutrine
intruders.</p>

<p>Scent and its vagaries will no doubt always be a
mysterious problem. How often have we seen
hounds able to hunt quite well amongst the undergrowth,
yet when they reached an open expanse of
sand where the seal of an otter was plainly visible,
they have crossed it without a single hound speaking.
An instance of this comes to mind during the
season of 1921, when hounds ran well across
country, whereas on a sand-bank, literally padded
flat with otter tracks, never a hound opened.</p>

<p>Although hounds may sometimes travel a long
way up-stream without touching a drag, that does
not always signify that you will not find. An
instance of this comes to mind when we were
hunting a small hill-stream. Hounds had covered
some miles of water without a sign of a drag, and
the field was becoming rather discouraged, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">« 148 »</a></span>
suddenly the pack opened in no uncertain manner,
and began tearing at a holt on the bank. While
hounds were thus occupied, the otter bolted and
went downstream, and after a short hunt was
accounted for. Until reaching the spot where
hounds marked, there was little or no lying ground,
and seeing that there was also no up-stream drag
it pointed to the fact that our otter had travelled
over a neighbouring watershed, and had entered
the holt on his journey downstream. It is always
well to remember that an otter may be found anywhere,
and because there happens to be no drag
up-stream that does not mean to say that you may
not find when you reach the head waters.</p>

<p>Regarding the agility and jumping powers of
otters we remember hounds finding an otter lying
rough, which, after a certain amount of dusting
up and down stream, jumped a wall into a road,
passed under a motor car standing there, and went
over another wall into the field beyond. Leaving
the field it scaled a third wall before returning to
the water. Eventually it took to some extensive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">« 149 »</a></span>
coverts, and after running a ring through them, it
was bowled over by hounds in the open as it was
making its way back to the river. That an otter
knows every inch of ground over which he has once
travelled is made quite apparent to those who do
much otter-hunting.</p>

<p>We have, in a previous chapter, told of an otter
which travelled ten miles overland from one stream
to another, going straight to the various smoots
through the walls which barred its passage. In
an emergency, too, an otter makes up his mind
pretty quickly. On one occasion the terriers got
to their otter in a drain, and after opening the
latter, the otter backed out. The drain lay
parallel to a hedge, and like a flash the otter darted
through this, ran down behind it, and was into
another underground retreat before anyone had
time to realise his game.</p>

<p>As a rule, if two otters are put down together, the
one which is not being hunted will promptly make
itself scarce. We remember on one occasion,
however, when hounds were hunting a bitch otter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">« 150 »</a></span>
the dog hung about in plain sight under a bridge,
and remained there until the bitch was accounted
for, after which he himself suffered the same fate.</p>

<p>Otter-hunting is the least artificial of our British
field sports. The otter is a wild animal, living
the same free life that he has done for generations,
and we have yet to learn a good deal concerning
him. Being a great wanderer, he is here to-day
and gone to-morrow, and his hunting provides
more "glorious uncertainty" than the chase of any
other beast. Before you can hunt him you must
find him, but whereas with deer, fox, and hare, the
finding is often the easiest part of the business, in
the case of the otter it is the most difficult. In
a previous chapter we have made brief mention
of otter-hunting dress. In these days blue is the
popular colour for Hunt livery, the material most
favoured being woollen serge. We wonder how
modern otter-hunters would like to wear the dress
mentioned by Blaine, i.e., a green dress turned up
with red, fur cap with gold band, and waterproof
hip-boots decorated with red or gold tassels.</p>

<p>It was Somervile in <i>The Chase</i> who coined
the phrase "sly goose-footed prowler," and gave
to the world one of the best accounts of an otter-hunt
ever penned. Otter-hunting seems to have
been little catered for in the matter of songs pertaining
to the sport. No doubt there are many
purely local ditties concerning the doings of
various packs, but few songs of real worth have
made their appearance. In "The Poetry of
Sport" by Hedley Peek, we find one or two, and
in the "Otter-hunting Diary" of Mr James
Lomax there are a couple of Lancashire otter-hunting
songs. One of these songs is in dialect,
and we take the liberty of quoting a verse or two
for to anyone who understands broad Lancashire
they convey a lively description of the sport. The
song is entitled "The Hunt in the Hodder." In
the first verse the narrator goes to the meet:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Old Squire Lomax's dags I'd oft heerd um tell,<br /></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">« 152 »</a></span></div>

<span class="i0">Cobbler wur theer, Carver wur theer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Random and Rover, oud Pilot and aw."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>After a good drag, hounds mark their otter in his
holt, and Crab the terrier is sent in.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hark! Crab's agate feighting him, hard as he con,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be sharp un seize howd of a dog, every mon.<br /></span>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Chorus</i><br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Hounds swim their otter for some time until at
last he takes refuge in a holt.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We swum him to Winckley, un theer he dud hoyle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a pick un a spade soon his harbour dud spoil;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he fought into Ribble, ay, reet thro' the pack,<br /></span>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Chorus</i><br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Hounds eventually account for their otter, and
the song finishes with:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"This otter whoas weight wor just twenty-four peands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two hears, forty minits, wor hunted by th' heands;<br /></span>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Chorus</i><br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">« 153 »</a></span></p>

<p>A rather amusing incident occurred some years
ago when we were whipping-in to the now
disbanded Lake District Otterhounds. Whilst
waiting at Lakeside for the boat that runs up
Lake Windermere, a char-a-banc load of trippers
arrived, to whom the sight of a pack of otterhounds
was evidently a novelty. Before we
knew what was happening, the crowd of sightseers
had formed a ring round hounds, each
member of the party producing a song book.
There then rose on the air the well-known refrain
"John Peel." The old huntsman listened whilst
they sang the first verse, then suddenly exclaimed
"Give it more weft! give it more weft!" Isaac
evidently thought that their efforts compared
badly with the way in which the old song is sung
by fox-hunters in Cumberland or Westmorland.</p>

<p>In addition to being the least artificial of our
British field sports, otter-hunting affords unrivalled
opportunities for those who love to watch the work
of hounds. It is more popular now than it ever
was, yet there is still ample room for many more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">« 154 »</a></span>
packs before our rivers and lakes are thoroughly
hunted as they should be. The more otters you
kill the more you will have, for riparian owners and
tenants are for the most part quite willing to afford
protection to <i>Lutra</i>, when they know that a keen
huntsman and a killing pack of hounds are hunting
their waters regularly throughout the season.</p>

<p>In conclusion we will finish with the old south-country
toast "Death to dog otters! Long life
to the little bitches!"</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
